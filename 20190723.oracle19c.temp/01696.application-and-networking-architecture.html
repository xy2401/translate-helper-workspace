                        <p>Oracle Database client/server architecture in a distributed processing environment provides a number of benefits.</p>
                        <p>Benefits include:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                           <li>
                              <p>Client applications are not responsible for performing data processing. Rather, they request input from users, request data from the server, and then analyze and present this data using the display capabilities of the client workstation or the terminal (for example, using graphics or spreadsheets). </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Client applications are not dependent on the physical location of the data. Even if the data is moved or distributed to other database servers, the application continues to function with little or no modification. </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Oracle Database exploits the multitasking and shared-memory facilities of its underlying operating system. Consequently, it delivers the highest possible degree of concurrency, data integrity, and performance to its client applications. </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Client workstations or terminals can be optimized for the presentation of data (for example, by providing graphics and mouse support), while the server can be optimized for the processing and storage of data (for example, by having large amounts of memory and disk space). </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>In networked environments, you can use inexpensive client workstations to access the remote data of the server effectively. </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>The database can scale as your system grows. You can add multiple servers to distribute the database processing load throughout the network (horizontally scaled), or you can move the database to a minicomputer or mainframe to take advantage of a larger system's performance (vertically scaled). In either case, data and applications are maintained with little or no modification because Oracle Database is portable between systems.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>In networked environments, shared data is stored on the servers rather than on all computers, making it easier and more efficient to manage concurrent access. </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>In networked environments, client applications submit database requests to the server using SQL statements. After it is received, each SQL statement is processed by the server, which returns results to the client. Network traffic is minimized because only the requests and the results are shipped over the network. </p>
                           </li>

                        <p>An application server permits thin clients, which are clients equipped with minimal software configurations, to access applications without requiring ongoing maintenance of the client computers.

                        <p>The application server assumes the identity of the client when it is performing operations on the database server for this client.

                     <div>
                        <p>The database can serve as a Web service provider in traditional multitier or <strong class="term">service-oriented architecture (SOA)</strong> environments. 
                        </p>
                        <p>SOA is a multitier architecture relying on services that support computer-to-computer interaction over a network. In the context of SOA, a service is a self-sufficient functional endpoint that has a well defined functionality and service level agreement, can be monitored and managed, and can help enforce policy compliance.</p>
                        <p>SOA services are usually implemented as Web services accessible through the HTTP protocol. They are based on XML standards such as WSDL and SOAP.</p>
                        <p>The Oracle Database Web service capability, which is implemented as part of Oracle XML DB, must be specifically enabled by the DBA. Applications can then accomplish the following through database Web services:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                           <li>
                              <p>Submit SQL or XQuery queries and receive results as XML</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Invoke standalone PL/SQL functions and receive results</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Invoke PL/SQL package functions and receive results</p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Database Web services provide a simple way to add Web services to an application environment without the need for an application server. However, invoking Web services through application servers such as Oracle Fusion Middleware offers security, scalability, UDDI registration, and reliable messaging in an SOA environment. However, because database Web services integrate easily with Oracle Fusion Middleware, they may be appropriate for optimizing SOA solutions.</p>

                  <p><span class="bold">Oracle Net Services</span> is a suite of networking components that provides enterprise-wide connectivity solutions in distributed, heterogeneous computing environments. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Oracle Net Services enables a network session from an application to a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-CFB1A30E-76B6-44EA-839E-9E63C8DA31AC"><span class="xrefglossterm">database instance</span></a> and a database instance to another database instance.
                  </p>
                  <p>Oracle Net Services provides location transparency, centralized configuration and management, and quick installation and configuration. It also lets you maximize system resources and improve performance. The <a href="glossary.html#GUID-E94CE0E3-CC86-4F46-B8EF-54945F026326"><span class="xrefglossterm">shared server</span></a> architecture increases the scalability of applications and the number of clients simultaneously connected to the database. The Virtual Interface (VI) protocol places most of the messaging burden on high-speed network hardware, freeing the CPU.
                  </p>
                  <p>Oracle Net Services uses the communication protocols or application programmatic interfaces (APIs) supported by a wide range of networks to provide distributed database and distributed processing. After a network session is established, Oracle Net Services acts as a data courier for the client application and the database server, establishing and maintaining a connection and exchanging messages. Oracle Net Services can perform these tasks because it exists on each computer in the network.</p>

During registration, the LREG process provides the listener with the instance name, database service names, and the type and addresses of service handlers. This information enables the listener to start a service handler when a client request arrives.

                        <p>In Oracle Net, <span class="bold">service registration</span> is a feature by which the LREG process dynamically registers instance information with a listener.
                        </p>
                        <p>This information enables the listener to forward client connection requests to the appropriate service handler. LREG provides the listener with information about the following:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                           <li>
                              <p>Names of the database services provided by the database</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Name of the database instance associated with the services and its current and maximum load</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Service handlers (dispatchers and dedicated servers) available for the instance, including their type, protocol addresses, and current and maximum load</p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Service registration is dynamic and does not require configuration in the <code class="codeph">listener.ora</code> file. Dynamic registration reduces administrative overhead for multiple databases or instances.
                        </p>
                        <p>The initialization parameter <code class="codeph">SERVICE_NAMES</code> lists the services an instance belongs to. On startup, each instance registers with the listeners of other instances belonging to the same services. During database operations, the instances of each service pass information about CPU use and current connection counts to all listeners in the same services. This communication enables dynamic load balancing and connection failover.
                        </p>

                     <p>A one-to-one ratio exists between the client processes and server processes. Even when the user is not actively making a database request, the dedicated server process remains—although it is inactive and can be paged out on some operating systems.</p>
                     <p><a href="application-and-networking-architecture.html#GUID-94AFB4A0-4979-4B48-A19A-0D9178771FB1__CHDEECGC">Figure 16-7</a> shows user and server processes running on networked computers. However, the dedicated server architecture is also used if the same computer runs both the client application and the database code but the host operating system could not maintain the separation of the two programs if they were run in a single process. Linux is an example of such an operating system.
                     </p>
                     <p>In the dedicated server architecture, the user and server processes communicate using different mechanisms:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>If the client process and the dedicated server process run on the same computer, then the program interface uses the host operating system's interprocess communication mechanism to perform its job.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>If the client process and the dedicated server process run on different computers, then the program interface provides the communication mechanisms (such as the network software and Oracle Net Services) between the programs.</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Underutilized dedicated servers sometimes result in inefficient use of operating system resources. Consider an order entry system with dedicated server processes. A customer places an order as a clerk enters the order into the database. For most of the transaction, the clerk is talking to the customer while the server process dedicated to the clerk's client process is idle. The server process is not needed during most of the transaction, and the system may be slower for other clerks entering orders if the system is managing too many processes. For applications of this type, the shared server architecture may be preferable.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>In a <span class="bold">shared server</span> architecture, a dispatcher directs multiple incoming network session requests to a pool of shared server processes
                     </p>
                     <p>The shared pool eliminates the need for a dedicated server process for each connection. An idle shared server process from the pool picks up a request from a common queue.</p>
                     <p>The potential benefits of shared server are as follows:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Reduces the number of processes on the operating system</p>
                           <p>A small number of shared servers can perform the same amount of processing as many dedicated servers.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Reduces instance PGA memory</p>
                           <p>Every dedicated or shared server has a PGA. Fewer server processes means fewer PGAs and less process management.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Increases application scalability and the number of clients that can simultaneously connect to the database</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>May be faster than dedicated server when the rate of client connections and disconnections is high</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Shared server has several disadvantages, including slower response time in some cases, incomplete feature support, and increased complexity for setup and tuning. As a general guideline, only use shared server when you have more concurrent connections to the database than the operating system can handle.</p>
                     <p>The following processes are needed in a shared server architecture: </p>

                     <div>
                        <p>A request from a user is a single API call that is part of the user's SQL statement.</p>
                        <p>When a user makes a call, the following actions occur:</p>
                        <ol>
                           <li>
                              <p>The dispatcher places the request on the request queue, where it is picked up by the next available shared server process.</p>
                              <p>The request queue is in the SGA and is common to all dispatcher processes of an instance.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>The shared server processes check the common request queue for new requests, picking up new requests on a first-in-first-out basis. </p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>One shared server process picks up one request in the queue and makes all necessary calls to the database to complete this request.</p>
                              <p>A different server process can handle each database call. Therefore, requests to parse a query, fetch the first row, fetch the next row, and close the result set may each be processed by a different shared server.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>When the server process completes the request, it places the response on the calling dispatcher's response queue. Each dispatcher has its own response queue.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>The dispatcher returns the completed request to the appropriate client process. </p>
                           </li>
                        </ol>
                        <p>For example, in an order entry system, each clerk's client process connects to a dispatcher. Each request made by the clerk is sent to this dispatcher, which places the request in the queue. The next available shared server picks up the request, services it, and puts the response in the response queue. When a request is completed, the clerk remains connected to the dispatcher, but the shared server that processed the request is released and available for other requests. While one clerk talks to a customer, another clerk can use the same shared server process.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>Database Resident Connection Pooling (DRCP) provides a connection pool of dedicated servers for typical Web application scenarios. </p>
                     <p>A Web application typically makes a database connection, uses the connection briefly, and then releases it. Through DRCP, the database can scale to tens of thousands of simultaneous connections.</p>
                     <p>DRCP provides the following advantages:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Complements middle-tier connection pools that share connections between threads in a middle-tier process.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Enables database connections to be shared across multiple middle-tier processes. These middle-tier processes may belong to the same or different middle-tier host.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Enables a significant reduction in key database resources required to support many client connections. For example, DRCP reduces the memory required for the database and boosts the scalability of the database and middle tier. The pool of available servers also reduces the cost of re-creating client connections.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Provides pooling for architectures with multi-process, single-threaded application servers, such as PHP and Apache, that cannot do middle-tier connection pooling. </p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>DRCP uses a <span class="bold">pooled server</span>, which is the equivalent of a dedicated server process (not a shared server process) and a database session combined. The pooled server model avoids the overhead of dedicating a server for every connection that requires the server for a short period.
                     </p>
                     <p>Clients obtaining connections from the database resident connection pool connect to an Oracle background process known as the connection broker. The connection broker implements the pool functionality and multiplexes pooled servers among inbound connections from client processes.</p>
                     <p>As shown in <a href="application-and-networking-architecture.html#GUID-531EEE8A-B00A-4C03-A2ED-D45D92B3F797__CHDHGCAC">Figure 16-9</a>, when a client requires database access, the connection broker picks up a server process from the pool and hands it off to the client. The client is directly connected to the server process until the request is served. After the server has finished, the server process is released into the pool. The connection from the client is restored to the broker.
                     </p>
                     <div class="figure" id="GUID-531EEE8A-B00A-4C03-A2ED-D45D92B3F797__CHDHGCAC">

                     <!-- class="figure" -->
                     <p>In DRCP, releasing resources leaves the session intact, but no longer associated with a connection (server process). Unlike in shared server, this session stores its UGA in the PGA, not in the SGA. A client can reestablish a connection transparently upon detecting activity.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>The <span class="bold">program interface</span> is the software layer between a database application and Oracle Database.
                  </p>
                  <p>The program interface performs the following functions:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Provides a security barrier, preventing destructive access to the SGA by client processes</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Acts as a communication mechanism, formatting information requests, passing data, and trapping and returning errors</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Converts and translates data, particularly between different types of computers or to external user program data types</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The <span class="bold">Oracle code</span> acts as a server, performing database tasks on behalf of an application (a client), such as fetching rows from data blocks. The program interface consists of several parts, provided by both Oracle Database software and operating system-specific software.

                  <div>
                     <p>The program interface consists of several different components.</p>
                     <p>These components include:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Oracle call interface (OCI) or the Oracle run-time library (SQLLIB)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>The client or user side of the program interface</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Various Oracle Net Services drivers (protocol-specific communications software)</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Operating system communications software</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>The server or Oracle Database side of the program interface (also called the OPI)</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>The user and Oracle Database sides of the program interface run Oracle software, as do the drivers.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>A driver is a piece of software that transports data, usually across a network. </p>
                     <p>Drivers perform operations such as connect, disconnect, signal errors, and test for errors. Drivers are specific to a communications protocol. </p>
                     <p>A default driver always exists. You can install multiple drivers, such as the asynchronous or DECnet drivers, and select one as the default driver, but allow a user to use other drivers by specifying a driver when connecting. </p>
                     <p>Different processes can use different drivers. A process can have concurrent connections to a single database or to multiple databases using different Oracle Net Services drivers.</p>

                     <p>The lowest-level software connecting the user side to the Oracle Database side of the program interface is the communications software, which the host operating system provides.</p>
                     <p>DECnet, TCP/IP, LU6.2, and ASYNC are examples. The communication software can be supplied by Oracle, but it is usually purchased separately from the hardware vendor or a third-party software supplier.</p>
