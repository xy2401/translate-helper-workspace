                  <div>
                     <p>When you encrypt data, you should be aware that encryption must not interfere with how you configure access control. </p>
                     <p>Most organizations must limit data access to users who need to see this data. For example, a human resources system may limit employees to viewing only their own employment records, while allowing managers of employees to see the employment records of subordinates. Human resource specialists may also need to see employee records for multiple employees.</p>
                     <p>Typically, you can use access control mechanisms to address security policies that limit data access to those with a need to see it. Oracle Database has provided strong, independently evaluated access control mechanisms for many years. It enables access control enforcement to a fine level of granularity through Virtual Private Database.</p>
                     <p>Because human resource records are considered sensitive information, it is tempting to think that all information should be encrypted for better security. However, encryption cannot enforce granular access control, and it may hinder data access. For example, an employee, his manager, and a human resources clerk may all need to access an employee record. If all employee data is encrypted, then all three must be able to access the data in unencrypted form. Therefore, the employee, the manager and the human resources clerk would have to share the same encryption key to decrypt the data. Encryption would, therefore, not provide any additional security in the sense of better access control, and the encryption might hinder the proper or efficient functioning of the application. An additional issue is that it is difficult to securely transmit and share encryption keys among multiple users of a system.</p>
                     <p>A basic principle behind encrypting stored data is that it must not interfere with access control. For example, a user who has the <code class="codeph">SELECT</code> privilege on <code class="codeph">emp</code> should not be limited by the encryption mechanism from seeing all the data he is otherwise allowed to see. Similarly, there is little benefit to encrypting part of a table with one key and part of a table with another key if users need to see all encrypted data in the table. In this case, encryption adds to the overhead of decrypting the data before users can read it. If access controls are implemented well, then encryption adds little additional security within the database itself. A user who has privileges to access data within the database has no more nor any less privileges as a result of encryption. Therefore, you should never use encryption to solve access control problems.

                  <div>
                     <p>You can protect your databases against malicious database administrators by using other Oracle features, such as Oracle Database Vault. </p>
                     <p>Some organizations, concerned that a malicious user might gain elevated (database administrator) privileges by guessing a password, like the idea of encrypting stored data to protect against this threat. </p>
                     <p>However, the correct solution to this problem is to protect the database administrator account, and to change default passwords for other privileged accounts. The easiest way to break into a database is by using a default password for a privileged account that an administrator allowed to remain unchanged. One example is <code class="codeph">SYS</code>/<code class="codeph">CHANGE_ON_INSTALL</code>.
                     </p>
                     <p>While there are many destructive things a malicious user can do to a database after gaining the <code class="codeph">DBA</code> privilege, encryption will not protect against many of them. Examples include corrupting or deleting data, exporting user data to the file system to email the data back to himself to run a password cracker on it, and so on. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Some organizations are concerned that database administrators, typically having all privileges, are able to see all data in the database. These organizations feel that the database administrators should administer the database, but should not be able to see the data that the database contains. Some organizations are also concerned about concentrating so much privilege in one person, and would prefer to partition the DBA function, or enforce two-person access rules.</p>
                     <p>It is tempting to think that encrypting all data (or significant amounts of data) will solve these problems, but there are better ways to protect against these threats. For example, Oracle Database supports limited partitioning of <code class="codeph">DBA</code> privileges. Oracle Database provides native support for <code class="codeph">SYSDBA</code> and <code class="codeph">SYSOPER</code> users. <code class="codeph">SYSDBA</code> has all privileges, but <code class="codeph">SYSOPER</code> has a limited privilege set (such as startup and shutdown of the database). 
                     </p>
                     <p>Furthermore, you can create smaller roles encompassing several system privileges. A <code class="codeph">jr_dba</code> role might not include all system privileges, but only those appropriate to a junior database administrator (such as <code class="codeph">CREATE TABLE</code>, <code class="codeph">CREATE USER</code>, and so on). 
                     </p>
                     <p>Oracle Database also enables auditing the actions taken by <code class="codeph">SYS</code> (or <code class="codeph">SYS</code>-privileged users) and storing that audit trail in a secure operating system location. Using this model, a separate auditor who has root privileges on the operating system can audit all actions by <code class="codeph">SYS</code>, enabling the auditor to hold all database administrators accountable for their actions. 
                     </p>
                     <p>You can also fine-tune the access and control that database administrators have by using Oracle Database Vault. </p>
                     <p>The database administrator function is a trusted position. Even organizations with the most sensitive data, such as intelligence agencies, do not typically partition the database administrator function. Instead, they manage their database administrators strongly, because it is a position of trust. Periodic auditing can help to uncover inappropriate activities.</p>
                     <p>Encryption of stored data must not interfere with the administration of the database, because otherwise, larger security issues can result. For example, if by encrypting data you corrupt the data, then you create a security problem, the data itself cannot be interpreted, and it may not be recoverable.</p>
                     <p>You can use encryption to limit the ability of a database administrator or other privileged user to see data in the database. However, it is not a substitute for managing the database administrator privileges properly, or for controlling the use of powerful system privileges. If untrustworthy users have significant privileges, then they can pose multiple threats to an organization, some of them far more significant than viewing unencrypted credit card numbers.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>A common error is to think that if encrypting some data strengthens security, then encrypting everything makes all data secure.</p>
                     <p>As the discussion of the previous two principles illustrates, encryption does not address access control issues well, and it is important that encryption not interfere with normal access controls. Furthermore, encrypting an entire production database means that all data must be decrypted to be read, updated, or deleted. Encryption is inherently a performance-intensive operation; encrypting all data will significantly affect performance. </p>
                     <p>Availability is a key aspect of security. If encrypting data makes data unavailable, or adversely affects availability by reducing performance, then encrypting everything will create a new security problem. Availability is also adversely affected by the database being inaccessible when encryption keys are changed, as good security practices require on a regular basis. When the keys are to be changed, the database is inaccessible while data is decrypted and reencrypted with a new key or keys. </p>
                     <p>There may be advantages to encrypting data stored off-line. For example, an organization may store backups for a period of 6 months to a year off-line, in a remote location. Of course, the first line of protection is to secure the facility storing the data, by establishing physical access controls. Encrypting this data before it is stored may provide additional benefits. Because it is not being accessed on-line, performance need not be a consideration. While an Oracle database does not provide this capability, there are vendors who provide encryption services. Before embarking on large-scale encryption of backup data, organizations considering this approach should thoroughly test the process. It is essential to verify that data encrypted before off-line storage can be decrypted and re-imported successfully.</p>

                     <p>Special difficulties arise when encrypted data is indexed.</p>
                     <p></p>
                     <p>For example, suppose a company uses a national identity number, such as the U.S. Social Security number (SSN), as the employee number for its employees. The company considers employee numbers to be sensitive data, and, therefore, wants to encrypt data in the <code class="codeph">employee_number</code> column of the <code class="codeph">employees</code> table. Because <code class="codeph">employee_number</code> contains unique values, the database designers want to have an index on it for better performance.
                     </p>
                     <p>However, if <code class="codeph">DBMS_CRYPTO</code> (or another mechanism) is used to encrypt data in a column, then an index on that column will also contain encrypted values. Although an index can be used for equality checking (for example, <code class="codeph">SELECT * FROM emp WHERE employee_number = '987654321'</code>), if the index on that column contains encrypted values, then the index is essentially unusable for any other purpose. You should not encrypt indexed data. 
                     </p>
                     <p>Oracle recommends that you do not use national identity numbers as unique IDs. Instead, use the <code class="codeph">CREATE SEQUENCE</code> statement to generate unique identity numbers. Reasons to avoid using national identity numbers are as follows:
                     </p>

                        <li>
                           <p>Sometimes national identity numbers can have duplicates, as with U.S. Social Security numbers.</p>

                     <p>An encryption key must be securely generated using secure cryptographic key generation. Oracle Database provides support for secure random number generation, with the <code class="codeph">RANDOMBYTES</code> function of <code class="codeph">DBMS_CRYPTO</code>. (This function replaces the capabilities provided by the <code class="codeph">GetKey</code> procedure of the earlier <code class="codeph">DBMS_OBFUSCATION_TOOLKIT</code>, which has been deprecated.) <code class="codeph">DBMS_CRYPTO</code> calls the secure random number generator (RNG) previously certified by RSA Security.

                        <p>Do not use the <code class="codeph">DBMS_RANDOM</code> package.

                     <p>Be sure to provide the correct number of bytes when you encrypt a key value. For example, you must provide a 16-byte key for the <code class="codeph">ENCRYPT_AES128</code> encryption algorithm.

                     <div>
                        <p>Storing encryption keys in the database does not always prevent a database administrator from accessing encrypted data.</p>
                        <p>An all-privileged database administrator could still access tables containing encryption keys. However, it can often provide good security against the casual curious user or against someone compromising the database file on the operating system. </p>
                        <p>As a trivial example, suppose you create a table (<code class="codeph">EMP</code>) that contains employee data. You want to encrypt the employee Social Security number (SSN) stored in one of the columns. You could encrypt employee SSN using a key that is stored in a separate column. However, anyone with <code class="codeph">SELECT</code> access on the entire table could retrieve the encryption key and decrypt the matching SSN. 
                        </p>
                        <p>While this encryption scheme seems easily defeated, with a little more effort you can create a solution that is much harder to break. For example, you could encrypt the SSN using a technique that performs some additional data transformation on the <code class="codeph">employee_number</code> before using it to encrypt the SSN. This technique might be as simple as using an <code class="codeph">XOR</code> operation on the <code class="codeph">employee_number</code> and the birth date of the employee to determine the validity of the values. 
                        </p>
                        <p>As additional protection, PL/SQL source code performing encryption can be wrapped, (using the <code class="codeph">WRAP</code> utility) which obfuscates (scrambles) the code. The <code class="codeph">WRAP</code> utility processes an input SQL file and obfuscates the PL/SQL units in it. For example, the following command uses the <code class="codeph">keymanage.sql</code> file as the input:
                        </p><pre class="oac_no_warn" dir="ltr">wrap iname=/mydir/keymanage.sql
</pre><p>A developer can subsequently have a function in the package call the <code class="codeph">DBMS_CRYPTO</code> package calls with the key contained in the wrapped package. 
                        </p>
                        <p>Oracle Database enables you to obfuscate dynamically generated PL/SQL code. The <code class="codeph">DBMS_DDL</code> package contains two subprograms that allow you to obfuscate dynamically generated PL/SQL program units. For example, the following block uses the <code class="codeph">DBMS_DDL.CREATE_WRAPPED</code> procedure to wrap dynamically generated PL/SQL code.
                        </p><pre class="oac_no_warn" dir="ltr">BEGIN
......
SYS.DBMS_DDL.CREATE_WRAPPED(<span class="italic">function_returning_PLSQL_code</span>());
......
END;
</pre><p>While wrapping is not unbreakable, it makes it harder for an intruder to get access to the encryption key. Even in cases where a different key is supplied for each encrypted data value, you should not embed the key value within a package. Instead, wrap the package that performs the key management (that is, data transformation or padding).</p>

                        <p>An alternative to wrapping the data is to have a separate table in which to store the encryption key and to envelope the call to the keys table with a procedure. The key table can be joined to the data table using a primary key to foreign key relationship. For example, <code class="codeph">employee_number</code> is the primary key in the <code class="codeph">employees</code> table that stores employee information and the encrypted SSN. The <code class="codeph">employee_number</code> column is a foreign key to the <code class="codeph">ssn_keys</code> table that stores the encryption keys for the employee SSN. The key stored in the <code class="codeph">ssn_keys</code> table can also be transformed before use (by using an <code class="codeph">XOR</code> operation), so the key itself is not stored unencrypted. If you wrap the procedure, then that can hide the way in which the keys are transformed before use.
                        </p>
                        <p>The strengths of this approach are:</p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                           <li>
                              <p>Users who have direct table access cannot see the sensitive data unencrypted, nor can they retrieve the keys to decrypt the data.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Access to decrypted data can be controlled through a procedure that selects the encrypted data, retrieves the decryption key from the key table, and transforms it before it can be used to decrypt the data.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>The data transformation algorithm is hidden from casual snooping by wrapping the procedure, which obfuscates the procedure code.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p><code class="codeph">SELECT</code> access to both the data table and the keys table does not guarantee that the user with this access can decrypt the data, because the key is transformed before use.
                              </p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The weakness to this approach is that a user who has <code class="codeph">SELECT</code> access to both the key table and the data table, and who can derive the key transformation algorithm, can break the encryption scheme. 
                        </p>
                        <p>The preceding approach is not infallible, but it is adequate to protect against easy retrieval of sensitive information stored in clear text.</p>

                        <p>Considering that 40 percent of help desk calls are from users who have forgotten their passwords, you can see the risks of having users manage encryption keys. In all likelihood, users will either forget an encryption key, or write the key down, which then creates a security weakness.

                        <p>If you do decide to have user-supplied or user-managed keys, then you need to ensure you are using native network encryption so that the key is not passed from the client to the server in the clear. You also must develop key archive mechanisms, which is also a difficult security problem. Key archives and backdoors create the security weaknesses that encryption is attempting to solve.</p>

                  <p><code class="codeph">DBMS_CRYPTO</code> supports a range of algorithms that accommodate both new and existing systems. Although 3DES_2KEY and MD4 are provided for backward compatibility, you achieve better security using 3DES, AES, or SHA-1. Therefore, 3DES_2KEY is not recommended.
                  </p>
                  <p>The <code class="codeph">DBMS_CRYPTO</code> package includes cryptographic checksum capabilities (MD5), which are useful for comparisons, and the ability to generate a secure random number (the <code class="codeph">RANDOMBYTES</code> function). Secure random number generation is an important part of cryptography; predictable keys are easily guessed keys; and easily guessed keys may lead to easy decryption of data. Most cryptanalysis is done by finding weak keys or poorly stored keys, rather than through brute force analysis (cycling through all possible keys).

                  <p>Key management is programmatic. That is, the application (or caller of the function) must supply the encryption key. This means that the application developer must find a way of storing and retrieving keys securely. The relative strengths and weaknesses of various key management techniques are discussed in the sections that follow. The DES algorithm itself has an effective key length of 56-bits.</p>

This bug has been fixed in Oracle Database Release 12c. Therefore, after an upgrade from Oracle Database release 11g to Release 12c, the ciphertexts that were encrypted using OFB mode in release 11g will no longer decrypt properly in the corrected OFB mode in Oracle Database Release 12c or later.
