            <p>The Parallel Execution tab is shown.</p>
            <p>Four line charts are shown.</p>
            <p>In the first chart, the y-axis units are sessions. The y-axis values range from 0 to 4. The x-axis units are hours of day, shown in 3-hour intervals. The values range from 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. The following types of information are tracked in the chart: Active Serial Sessions and Active Parallel Sessions. The chart shows that serial sessions remained at around 1 until 1:00 p.m when they spiked at 3.75. They dropped to 2 at 1:30 and then rose to 4 at 2:00 p.m. They then fell gradually back to 1 by 4:30 p.m. Parallel session activity began at 12:30 p.m., spiked at 1 at 1:00 p.m., and fell back to 0 by 1:30 p.m. Parallel session activity rose gradually to 1.5 beginning at 1:30 p.m and fell back to 0 by 4:00 p.m.</p>
            <p>In the second chart, the y-axis units are sessions. The y-axis values range from 0 to 20. The x-axis units are hours of day, shown in 3-hour intervals. The values range from 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. The following types of information are tracked in the chart: Parallel QC and Parallel Slaves. Parallel slave activity began at 12:30 p.m., spiked at 1 at 1:00 p.m., and fell back to 0 by 1:30 p.m. Parallel slave activity then rose to 4 by 2:00 p.m., stayed at 4 until 3:30 p.m., and then fell back to 0 by 4:00 p.m. There is minor Parallel QC activity from 2:00 p.m. to 4:00 p.m. </p>
            <p>In the third chart, the y-axis units are queries per second. The y-axis values range from 0 to 3. The x-axis units are hours of day, shown in 3-hour intervals. The values range from 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. The following types of information are tracked in the chart: DDL Statements Parallelized, DML Statements Parallelized, and Queries Parallelized. The parallel queries activity spiked at 1.2 per second at 1:00 p.m. and again at 3 per second at 2:30 p.m.</p>
            <p>In the fourth chart, the y-axis units are queries per second. The y-axis values range from 0 to 3. The x-axis units are hours of day, shown in 3-hour intervals. The values range from 5:00 a.m. to 2:00 a.m. The following types of information are tracked in the chart: Serialized, Downgraded 100%, Downgraded 75%, Downgraded 50%, Downgraded 25%, and Not Downgraded.
