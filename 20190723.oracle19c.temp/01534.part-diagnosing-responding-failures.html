Sometimes a software malfunction can corrupt data blocks. In a physical corruption, which is also called a media corruption, the database does not recognize the block.A media failure occurs when a problem external to the database prevents it from reading from or writing to a file during normal operations. RMAN provides multiple methods of data repair.In an RMAN restore operation, you select files to be restored and then run the RESTORE command. Typically, you restore files in preparation for media recovery.RMAN uses the records of available backup sets or image copies in the RMAN repository to select the best available backups for use in the restore operation.RMAN automatically uses restore failover to skip corrupted or inaccessible backups and look for usable backups. When a backup is not found, or contains corrupt data, RMAN automatically looks for another backup from which to restore the desired files. RMAN automatically decrypts backup sets that are protected with backup encryption when their contents are restored. Additional steps, if any, depend on the on the technique that was used to encrypt the backups.When Automatic Storage Management (ASM) disk groups are used, an RMAN restore operation creates new copies of data files only if the full name of a data file, including the incarnation, does not match with the name of an existing data file. RMAN uses restore optimization to avoid restoring data files from backup when possible. If a data file is present in the correct location and its header contains the expected information, then RMAN does not restore the data file from backup.In media recovery, RMAN applies changes to restored data to roll forward this data in time. RMAN automates media recovery. RMAN automatically restores and applies both incremental backups and archived redo logs in whatever combination is most efficient.A database incarnation is created whenever you open the database with the RESETLOGS option. RMAN performs certain actions when you open the database with the RESETLOGS option.A pluggable database (PDB) incarnation is a subincarnation of the multitenant container database (CDB) and is expressed as (database_incarnation, pdb_incarnation). When a database goes through multiple incarnations, some backups can become orphaned backups. Orphaned backups are backups created during incarnations of the database that are not in the direct ancestral path.Orphan PDB backups can result when you perform point-in-time recovery on a pluggable database (PDB) and then open the PDB using the RESETLOGS option."> RMAN Data Repair Concepts </a></p>

The GUI interface is available in Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control.A checker is a diagnostic operation or procedure registered with the Health Monitor to assess the health of the database or its components. A failure is a persistent data corruption that is detected by a data integrity check.Every failure has a failure status: OPEN or CLOSED. Every failure has a failure priority: CRITICAL, HIGH, or LOW. Data Recovery Advisor only assigns CRITICAL or HIGH priority to diagnosed failures.For clarity, Data Recovery Advisor groups related failures together. The ADVISE FAILURE command can present both manual and automatic repair options. Data Recovery Advisor categorizes manual actions as either mandatory or optional.When possible, Data Recovery Advisor consolidates repairs to fix multiple failures into a single repair. A consolidated repair may contain multiple steps.Whenever Data Recovery Advisor generates an automated repair option, it creates a script that explains which commands RMAN intends to use to repair the failure. Data Recovery Advisor prints the location of this script, which is a text file residing on the operating system. Data Recovery Advisor is supported only on some database configurations.Data Recovery Advisor only supports single-instance databases. Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) databases are not supported.There are some limitations with Data Recovery Advisor in an Oracle Data Guard environment.Data Recovery Advisor can only be used to diagnose and repair data corruptions in non-CDBs and the root of a multitenant container database (CDB). Data Recovery Advisor is not supported for pluggable databases (PDBs).The Data Recovery Advisor workflow begins when you either suspect or discover a failure. You can discover failures in many ways, including error messages, alerts, trace files, and failed data integrity checks.You can use the Data Recovery Advisor to automatically diagnose data failures, determine appropriate repair options, and execute repairs in a CDB. If you suspect or know that one or more database failures have occurred, then use LIST FAILURE to obtain information about them.The easiest way to determine problems that your database is encountering is to use the LIST FAILURE command. Besides providing more verbose output, LIST FAILURE also enables you to restrict output.The database invokes data integrity checks reactively when a user transaction is trying to access corrupted data. In some cases, latent failures can go undetected. Use the ADVISE FAILURE command to display repair options after running LIST FAILURE in an RMAN session. This command prints a summary of the failures and implicitly closes all open failures that are repaired.If one or more failures exist, then you typically use LIST FAILURE to show information about the failures and then ADVISE FAILURE in the same RMAN session to obtain a report of your repair options.You can also request repair options for specific failures. You can specify failures by status (CRITICAL, HIGH, or LOW) or by failure number. You can also use EXCLUDE FAILURE to exclude one or more failures from the report.You can use Data Recovery Advisor to repair failures automatically.If ADVISE FAILURE suggests manual repairs, then try these first. If manual repairs are not possible, or if they do not repair all failures, then you can use REPAIR FAILURE to automatically fix failures suggested in the most recent ADVISE FAILURE command in your current RMAN session.By default the script is displayed to standard output. You can use the SPOOL command to write the script to an editable file.In some situations, you may want to use the CHANGE FAILURE command to alter the status or priority of a failure."> Diagnosing and Repairing Failures with Data Recovery Advisor </a></p>

You can also use RMAN to determine whether backups can be restored.The database prevents operations that result in unusable backup files or corrupted restored data files. A corrupt block is a block that has been changed so that it differs from what Oracle Database expects to find.In a physical corruption, which is also called a media corruption, the database does not recognize the block at all: the checksum is invalid, the block contains all zeros, or the header and footer of the block do not match. You can use the SET MAXCORRUPT command to set the total number of unmarked corruptions permitted in a file for RMAN backups. The default is zero, meaning that RMAN does not tolerate unmarked corrupt blocks of any kind.Oracle Database supports different techniques for detecting, repairing, and monitoring block corruption.You can use the VALIDATE command to manually check for physical and logical corruptions in database files. You can also use the BACKUP VALIDATE command to perform validation.You can run RESTORE...VALIDATE to test whether RMAN can restore a specific file or set of files from a backup. RMAN chooses which backups to use.RMAN enables you to validate multitenant container databases (CDBs) and pluggable databases (PDBs) using the VALIDATE command. The steps to validate a CDB are similar to the ones used to validate a non-CDB. There are multiple methods to validate PDBs.">Validating Database Files and Backups</a></p>

You to recover target databases to within a few subseconds of a database failure.You must plan your database restore and recovery strategy based on your recovery goal and which database files have been lost.The techniques for determining which files require restore or recovery depend upon the type of file that is lost.The database shuts down immediately when any of the multiplexed control files become inaccessible. The decision about when and how to recover depends on the state of the database and the location of its data files.An easy technique for determining which data files are missing is to run a VALIDATE DATABASE command. Although VALIDATE DATABASE is a good technique for determining whether files are inaccessible, you may want to use SQL queries to obtain more detailed information. It is recommended that you record the DBID of your database.Previewing backups helps you to ensure that all backups required for a restore and recovery operation are available.An offsite backup is stored in a remote location, such as a secure storage facility, and cannot be restored unless the media manager retrieves the media.Validating backups determines if the backups are usable.RMAN restores archived redo log files from backup automatically as needed to perform recovery.RMAN enables you to override the default location for restored archived redo log files.To manage disk space that is used to contain the restored logs, you can specify restore destinations for archived logs multiple times in one RUN block, to distribute restored logs among several destinations.For backups encrypted using certain techniques, you must provide the password that will be used to decrypt these backups.During complete recovery RMAN restores one or more data files and then applies all the redo generated after the restored backup.You use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to restore and recover the database. If you cannot restore data files to their default locations, then you must update the control file to reflect the new locations of the data files.This scenario assumes that database trgt has lost most or all of its data files. It also assumes that the database uses a fast recovery area.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands with the TABLESPACE option to perform complete recovery of a tablespaceYou can recover a database by switching to image copies of inaccessible data files. This technique takes less time than traditional restore and recovery because no backups need to be restored.When one or more data files are damaged, you can perform recovery by switching to existing image copies of the damaged data files.You can perform complete database recovery by switching to image copies of the damaged data files instead of restoring these data files.RMAN and Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) provide full support for backup and recovery in a multitenant environment. When you recover a whole CDB, you recover the root and all PDBs in a single operation.You might consider recovering only the root if a data corruption or user error occurs that affects only the root.You can perform complete recovery of one or more PDBs without affecting operations of other open PDBs.Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) provides an interface to recover PDBs.Use the RECOVER command to perform complete recovery using preplugin backups.Preplugin backups are used to restore and recover a PDB to its state at a time in the past that was before the PDB was plugged in to the current CDB. RMAN performs complete recovery of a PDB using preplugin backups. These preplugin backups were created on a source non-CDB or a source CDB before the PDB was migrated to the current target CDB. This example performs complete recovery of a PDB my_pdb in the destination CDB prod_cdb using preplugin backups.Because tablespaces in different PDBs can have the same name, to eliminate ambiguity, you must connect directly to a PDB to recover one or more of its tablespaces. In contrast, because data file numbers and paths are unique across the CDB, you can connect either to the root or to a PDB when recovering PDB data files.Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) provides an interface to recover tablespaces within a PDB.Recovering a CDB by switching to a copy is faster than traditional restore and recovery.RMAN enables you to use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform complete recovery of the application containers without impacting the other containers in the CDB.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform complete recovery of the application root.You can perform complete recovery of an application container, which includes the application root and all its application PDBs without impacting the other PDBs within the CDB.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform complete recovery of one or more application PDBs.You can recover sparse databases to the most recent point in time using the RESTORE and RECOVER commands.Performing recovery of a database containing sparse data files is very similar to performing recovery of a whole database.Performing recovery of a sparse CDB is very similar to performing the complete recovery of a sparse database. You can recover a sparse PDB while you are connected at the root level or at the CDB level."> Performing Complete Database Recovery </a></p>

                     <p><a href="rman-performing-flashback-dbpitr.html#GUID-5463669A-DC89-4FF4-ACCE-136A72DF687B" title="This overview describes the purpose and basic concepts of Oracle Flashback Technology and database point-in-time recovery.Certain situations are suited for using point-in-time recovery or flashback features to return the database or database object to its state at a previous point in time.Database point-in-time recovery (DBPITR) and Flashback features enable you to recover your database to a prior point in time.DBPITR works at the physical level to return the data files to their state at a target time in the past.RMAN provides support for point-in-time recovery for one or more PDBs. To recover PDBs, you must connect to the root as a user with SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP privilege. After recovery, old backups of the PDB remain valid and can be used if a media failure occurs.The flashback features of the Oracle Database are more efficient than media recovery in most circumstances in which they are available. You can use them to investigate past states of the database.Oracle Flashback Database is the most efficient alternative to DBPITR.Logical flashback features are used to recover tables and their contents to a past time.You can perform a Flashback Database operation for a whole multitenant container database (CDB) or for a particular pluggable database (PDB). A multitenant container database (CDB) can use shared undo or local undo. The technique used by RMAN to perform flashback database operations depends on the type of undo configuration for the CDB.RMAN provides methods to manage redo corruption to data blocks in a PDB.Flashback Table uses information in the undo tablespace rather than restored backups to retrieve the table. When a Flashback Table operation occurs, new rows are deleted and old rows are reinserted. The rest of your database remains available while the flashback of the table is being performed.To perform a Flashback Table operation, the table must be eligible to be flashed back and the user performing the operation must have the required privileges.To use the Flashback Table feature on one or more tables, use the FLASHBACK TABLE SQL statement with a target time or SCN.By default, the database disables triggers on the affected table before performing a FLASHBACK TABLE operation. After the operation, the database returns the triggers to the state they were in before the operation (enabled or disabled). You can retrieve objects from the recycle bin with the FLASHBACK TABLE ... TO BEFORE DROP statement.Flashback Drop reverses the effects of a DROP TABLE operation. Flashback Drop is faster than other recovery mechanisms that can be used in this situation, such as point-in-time recovery, and does not lead to downtime or loss of recent transactions.Prerequisites must be met before you perform a Flashback Drop operation.Use the FLASHBACK TABLE ... TO BEFORE DROP statement to recover objects from the recycle bin. You can specify either the name of the table in the recycle bin or the original table name.You can create, and then drop, several objects with the same original name. All dropped objects are stored in the recycle bin.Flashback Database reverses unwanted changes by returning your database to its state at a previous point in time.Flashback Database works by undoing changes to the data files that exist at the moment that you run the command. Prerequisites must be met to perform a Flashback Database operation.A Flashback Database operation uses the FLASHBACK DATABASE command to rewind the database to a past point in time.You can perform a flashback database operation for a whole multitenant container database (CDB) using the FLASHBACK DATABASE command.You can perform a flashback database operation for a single pluggable database (PDB) in a multitenant container database (CDB) using the FLASHBACK DATABASE command.Data dictionary views contain information that is used to monitor flashback database.RMAN DBPITR restores the database from backups before the target time for recovery, then uses incremental backups and redo to roll the database forward to the target time. You can recover to an SCN, time, log sequence number, or restore point. Oracle recommends that you create restore points at important times to make point-in-time recovery more manageable if it ever becomes necessary.Certain prerequisites must be met to perform database point-in-time recovery (DBPITR).Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform DBPITR.Use the RECOVER command to perform point-in-time recovery (PITR) of container databases (CDBs) and pluggable databases (PDBs). PITR of PDBs can only be performed using RMAN.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform point-in-time recovery for a whole CDB.When you recover one or more PDBs to a specified point-in-time, the remaining PDBs in the CDB are not affected and they can be open and operational. Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform point-in-time recovery of an application PDB.Performing point-in-time recovery of sparse databases is similar to performing point-in-time recovery of normal databases. This section describes variations of the basic Flashback Database and DBPITR scenarios.Flashback Database can be used to undo an OPEN RESETLOGS operation.Flashback Database across OPEN RESETLOGS may be used to perform multiple functions in a Data Guard environment.You can use Flashback Database to rewind a database to an abandoned database incarnation.To perform DPITR to an noncurrent database incarnation, you must explicitly execute the RESET DATABASE to reset the database to the incarnation that was current at the target SCN. You must also restore a control file from the database incarnation containing the target SCN."> Performing Flashback and Database Point-in-Time Recovery</a></p>

Usually, the database marks a block as media corrupt and then writes it to disk when the corruption is first encountered. No subsequent read of the block is successful until the block is recovered. You can perform block recovery only on blocks that are marked corrupt or that fail a corruption check.Block recovery behavior depends on whether the data block corruption was discovered on the primary database or the physical standby database.The V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION view displays blocks marked corrupt by database components such as RMAN, ANALYZE, and SQL queries.Block media recovery only requires an unbroken set of redo changes for the blocks being recovered. This is unlike data file recovery that requires an unbroken series of redo changes from the beginning of recovery to the end.Certain prerequisites must be met before you perform block media recovery by using the RECOVER ... BLOCK command.Use the RECOVER...BLOCK command to recover individual corrupt blocks in a data file.You identify the blocks that require recovery and then use any available backup to restore and recover these blocks.You can use the Data Recovery Advisor to diagnose and repair failures caused by data block corruptions. In this example, corrupt data blocks were discovered when the VALIDATE DATABASE command.RMAN can automatically recover all blocks listed in the V$DATABASE_BLOCK_CORRUPTION view."> Performing Block Media Recovery </a></p>

The incremental backups must be consistent, like all backups of a database run in NOARCHIVELOG mode, so you cannot make backups of the database when it is open.RMAN can restore a lost server parameter file to its default location or to a location of your choice. Unlike the loss of the control file, the loss of the server parameter file does not cause the instance to immediately stop. The instance may continue operating, although you must shut it down and restart it after restoring the server parameter file. If you have configured control file autobackups, then the server parameter file is backed up with the control file whenever an autobackup is taken. You can also restore the server parameter file as a client-side initialization parameter file with the TO PFILE 'filename' clause. When all current control files are lost, you must restore a backup control file.If all copies of the current control file are lost or damaged, then you must restore and mount a backup control file. You must then run the RECOVER command, even if no data files have been restored, and open the database with the RESETLOGS option. When restoring the control file, the default destination is all of the locations defined in the CONTROL_FILES initialization parameter. If the CONTROL_FILES initialization parameter is not set, then the database uses the same rules to determine the destination for the restored control file that it uses when creating a control file if the CONTROL_FILES parameter is not set.The process of recovering a control file depends on whether a recovery catalog is used.The commands for restoring a control file are the same whether or not the database uses a fast recovery area.Recovering a database with a backup control file and when no recovery catalog is used requires you to restore the control file from an autobackup.Disaster recovery includes the restoration and recovery of the target database after the loss of the entire target database, the recovery catalog database, all current control files, all online redo log files, and all parameter files.Certain prerequisites must be met before you perform disaster recovery using RMAN.Assume that the Linux server on which your database was running has been damaged beyond repair. Fortunately, you backed up the database to Oracle Secure Backup and have the tapes available. You can recover the database by using these backups.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to restore a database on a new host. Restoring a database on a new host is useful when you want to perform a test run of your disaster recovery procedures or to permanently move a database to a new host.Certain steps must be preformed to prepare for the restoration of the database on a new host.To move the database to a new host by using data file copies or backup sets on disk, you must transfer the files manually to the new host. This procedure assumes that RMAN is using a recovery catalog.It is recommended that you test whether you can restore your database to a new host.You can restore backups that were created using older versions of RMAN, up to Oracle Database 9i Release 2 (9.2.0.8). RMAN enables you to restore or recover files by connecting, over the network, to a physical standby database that contains the required files. You can restore an entire database, data files, control files, server parameter file, or tablespaces. Restoring files over the network is very useful in scenarios where you need to synchronize the primary and standby databases.RMAN restores database files, over the network, from a physical standby database by using the FROM SERVICE clause of the RESTORE command. You can perform recovery by fetching an incremental backup, over the network, from a primary database and then applying this incremental backup to the physical standby database. Recovering files by connecting, over the network, to a physical standby database is useful in certain scenarios.Use the RESTORE command to restore lost or damaged data files by connecting over the network to a primary database or physical standby database.RMAN rolls forward a physical standby database by creating an incremental backup that contains the changes to the primary database, transferring the incremental backup over the network to the physical standby database, and then applying the incremental backup to the physical standby database. All changes to data files on the primary database, beginning with the SCN in the standby data file header, are included in the incremental backup.Use the RECOVER STANDBY DATABASE command with the FROM SERVICE clause to refresh a physical standby database with changes that were made to the primary database."> Performing RMAN Recovery: Advanced Scenarios</a></p>

This section explains the basic concepts, preparatory tasks, and modes of running RMAN TSPITR.Recovery Manager (RMAN) TSPITR enables quick recovery of one or more tablespaces in a database to an earlier time without affecting the rest of the tablespaces and objects in the database.Understand the concepts of RMAN TSPITR such as the terminology and modes used.This section defines some common entities that are used by RMAN TSPITR.There are several modes of running RMAN TSPITR. The difference between the various modes of operation corresponds to how much automation versus customization you require in your environment. Select tablespaces from the recovery set, an auxiliary destination, and a target time before you perform fully automated RMAN TSPITR (default).Some database problems cannot be resolved with TSPITR because of certain restrictions and limitations.There are some limitations to consider when performing TSPITR.Be aware of certain precautions when not using a recovery catalog during TSPITR.Certain steps must be completed when preparing to perform TSPITR.It is extremely important that you choose the right target time or SCN for your TSPITR. Note that after you bring a tablespace online after TSPITR, you cannot use any backup from a time earlier than the moment you brought the tablespace online. Initially, your recovery set includes the data files for the tablespaces that you intend to recover. However, if objects in the tablespaces that you need have relationships (such as constraints) to objects in other tablespaces, then you must account for these relationships before you can perform TSPITRRMAN TSPITR requires that the tablespace that is being recovered be self-contained and that no SYS-owned objects reside in the tablespace. When you perform RMAN TSPITR on a tablespace, objects created after the target recovery time are lost. You can preserve such objects after they are identified by exporting them before TSPITR with the Data Pump Export utility and reimporting them afterward with Data Pump Import.In the default mode, RMAN bases as much of the configuration for TSPITR as possible on the target database. You can customize some aspects of RMAN TSPITR while still mostly following the procedure for performing fully automated RMAN TSPITR.You may not want the recovery set data files restored and recovered in their original locations. The SET NEWNAME command enables you to specify a new destination. When you specify a new destination for the recovery set, RMAN does not remove the original data files of the tablespaces.Unlike recovery set data files, which are usually stored in their original locations, auxiliary set data files must not overwrite the corresponding original files in the target database. If you do not specify an auxiliary set file location that is different from its original location, then TSPITR fails. The failure occurs when RMAN attempts to overwrite the corresponding file in the original database and discovers the file in use.Auxiliary set data files can have Oracle Managed Files (OMF) in the target and can use Automatic Storage Management (ASM) or non-ASM storage. TSPITR performs name conversion differently when the DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT initialization parameter is set and the OMF files are in ASM or non-ASM storage. You can use DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT and LOG_FILE_NAME_CONVERT initialization parameters for the auxiliary database to specify the conversion of the disk group. RMAN uses the pattern to convert the ASM disk group name and generates a valid OMF file name in the converted disk group. Multiple methods are available to rename OMF (non-ASM) file names for the auxiliary database.To specify a new name for an auxiliary set data file, you can enclose RECOVER TABLESPACE in a RUN command and use a SET NEWNAME command within the RUN block to rename the file. When you do not want to use an auxiliary destination for all of your auxiliary set data files, but you also do not want to name every file individually, you can include a DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT initialization parameter in the initialization parameter file used by the auxiliary database.Temp files are considered part of the auxiliary set for your database. When the auxiliary database is instantiated, RMAN recreates the temporary tablespaces of the target database and generates their names with the regular rules for the auxiliary data file names. TSPITR performance can be enhanced by redirecting RMAN to use existing image copies of the recovery set and auxiliary set data files. In this case, RMAN does not need to restore the data files from backup.The SET NEWNAME command enables you to specify the location of the image copies when performing TSPITR using image copies.The CONFIGURE AUXNAME command sets a persistent alternative location for an auxiliary set data file image copy, whereas the SET NEWNAME command sets an alternative location for the duration of a RUN command.This procedure uses CONFIGURE AUXNAME when performing TSPITR using image copies.The automatic auxiliary database uses a set of default initialization parameters. You can add other parameters, if required.If you use an initialization parameter file, then you can use the CONTROL_FILES initialization parameter to specify your own location for the control file of your auxiliary databaseTo perform recovery on the auxiliary and recovery sets after restoring them at the auxiliary database, RMAN may need to restore archived logs. When an auxiliary destination is being used, the archived logs are restored to that location.If you specify the LOG_FILE_NAME_CONVERT initialization parameter in your auxiliary database parameter file and the parameter successfully converts the names of the online redo logs of the target, then this parameter determines the online redo log location. Although Oracle recommends that you let RMAN manage all aspects of the auxiliary database, there may be times when you must create and manage your own auxiliary database. If you select this mode, you are responsible for setting up, starting, stopping and cleaning up the auxiliary database used in TSPITR.Creating an Oracle instance suitable for use as an auxiliary database requires you to perform a set of steps.There are multiple ways to create a password file for the auxiliary database.Use a text editor to create an initialization parameter file for the auxiliary database on the target database host. The auxiliary database must have a valid net service name. Before proceeding, use SQL*Plus to ensure that you can establish a SYSBACKUP or SYSDBA connection to the auxiliary database.Keep in mind certain guidelines when performing TSPITR with your own auxiliary instance.The default behavior for channels when you use your own auxiliary database for TSPITR can be overridden.You may want to use SET NEWNAME commands to refer to existing image copies of auxiliary set files to improve TSPITR performance, or to assign new names to the recovery set files for after TSPITR. Plan these commands, if necessary, and add them to the sequence of commands that you run for TSPITR.Complete the prerequisites and then follow the steps in this section to perform TSPITR with your own auxiliary database.Before beginning RMAN TSPITR, you must start the auxiliary database. Because the auxiliary database does not yet have a control file, you can only start the instance in NOMOUNT mode. Start RMAN and connect to the target database and the manually created auxiliary database.Use the RECOVER TABLESPACE command to perform TSPITR with your own auxiliary instance.This procedure uses the RECOVER TABLESPACE... UNTIL command to perform TSPITR.A variety of problems can cause RMAN TSPITR to fail. The problem must be identified and fixed.Name conflicts can occur between files in the target database, file names assigned by the SET NEWNAME or CONFIGURE AUXNAME commands, and file names generated by the effect of the DB_FILE_NAME_CONVERT parameter.During TSPITR, RMAN needs information about which tablespaces had undo segments at the TSPITR target time. This information is usually available in the recovery catalog, if one is used. If you are managing your own auxiliary database and TSPITR fails, do not attempt to rerun TSPITR without resolving the errors.">Performing RMAN Tablespace Point-in-Time Recovery (TSPITR) </a></p>

You can use previously-created RMAN backups to recover tables and table partitions to a specified point in time.To recover tables or table partitions, you need a full backup of undo, SYSTEM, SYSAUX, and the tablespace that contains the tables or table partitions. RMAN uses the RECOVER command to recover tables or table partitions to a specified point in time.RMAN performs a series of steps while automating the process of recovering tables or table partitions from an RMAN backup.RMAN creates an auxiliary database that it uses during the process of recovering the specified tables or table partitions. Multiple techniques are available to specify the location of auxiliary database files.After recovering tables or table partitions to the specified point in time on the auxiliary database, RMAN creates a Data Pump export dump file that contains the recovered objects. You can either specify a name and location for this dump file or allow RMAN to use a default name and location.By default, RMAN imports the recovered tables or table partitions, which are stored in the export dump file, into the target database. However, you can choose not to import the recovered tables or table partitions by using the NOTABLEIMPORT clause of the RESTORE command.Use the REMAP TABLE clause to rename recovered tables or table partitions in the target database. Recovering tables or table partitions into a different schema enables you to avoid name conflicts that may be caused by constraint, index, or trigger names that already existing in the source schema.Recovering tables and table partitions from RMAN backups by using the RECOVER command is subject to certain limitations.You must perform some preliminary tasks before you prepare to recover tables or table partitions .Certain prerequisites must be met before you recover tables or table partitions from RMAN backups.It is important to determine the exact point in time to which you want to recover the tables or table partitions. There are multiple ways to specify the point in time to which objects must be recovered.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to recover tables or table partitions.RMAN enables you to use the RECOVER command to recover one or more tables or table partitions in a pluggable database (PDB) to a specified point-in-time, without impacting other objects in the PDB. This section contains examples that cover multiple scenarios for recovering tables and table partitions.This example recovers multiple tables to a specified point in time that is represented using SYSDATE.This example uses RMAN backups to recover multiple table partitions.This example recovers multiple tables into a new schema that is different from the source schema."> Recovering Tables and Table Partitions from RMAN Backups</a></p>
