In this case, the database automatically maintains and deletes backups and archived redo logs as needed. However, manual maintenance of database backups and archived redo logs is sometimes necessary.RMAN provides multiple commands to maintain RMAN backups and repository records.RMAN always stores its metadata in the control file of each target database on which it performs operations. If you register a target database in the recovery catalog, then RMAN stores the metadata for this target database in the recovery catalog. The database in a Data Guard environment that creates a backup or copy is associated with the file. For example, if RMAN is connected to target database standby1 and backs it up, then this backup is associated with standby1.For a crosscheck, RMAN can only update the status of a file from AVAILABLE to EXPIRED when connected to the database associated with the file. RMAN can delete files when connected to any database. If RMAN is not connected as TARGET to the database associated with a file, and if RMAN cannot delete a file successfully, then RMAN prompts you to connect as TARGET to the database associated with the file. You must then use DELETE ... FORCE to delete the file metadata.If a maintenance command changes RMAN metadata only, then you can connect RMAN as TARGET to any database in the Data Guard environment. A backup remains associated with a database unless you explicitly use the CHANGE ... RESET DB_UNIQUE_NAME to associate the backup with a different database.RMAN is designed to work without a recovery catalog. If you choose not to use a recovery catalog, however, then the control file of each target database is the exclusive repository for RMAN metadata.The control file contains two types of records: circular reuse records and noncircular reuse records.When a control file record containing information about a file created in the fast recovery area is about to be reused, the database attempts to delete the file from the fast recovery area when the file is eligible for deletion. Otherwise, the database expands the size of the control file section containing the record for this file.The best way to prevent the loss of RMAN metadata because of overwritten control file records is to use a recovery catalog.If you are not using a recovery catalog to store RMAN metadata, then it is doubly important that you protect each target database control file.Although the fast recovery area is largely self-managing, some situations may require database administration intervention.RMAN uses certain rules to determine when files can be deleted from the fast recovery area.You can use the V$RECOVERY_FILE_DEST and V$RECOVERY_AREA_USAGE views to determine whether you have allocated enough space for your fast recovery area.You cannot manage the flashback logs in the fast recovery area directly other than by setting the flashback retention target or using guaranteed restore points.If the RMAN retention policy requires keeping a set of backups larger than the fast recovery area disk quota, or if the retention policy is set to NONE, then the fast recovery area can fill completely with no reclaimable space.Use the ALTER SYSTEM command to change the location of the fast recovery area.The ALTER SYSTEM command can be used to disable the fast recovery area.As a rule, the fast recovery area is self-maintaining. When an instance crashes during the creation of a file in the fast recovery area, however, the database may leave the file in the fast recovery area.Several situations can cause a discrepancy between the repository and the files that it records, including tape or disk failures and user-managed copies or deletions of RMAN-related files.To ensure that data about backups in the recovery catalog or control file is synchronized with corresponding data on disk or in the media management catalog, perform a crosscheck. The CROSSCHECK command operates only on files that are currently recorded in the RMAN repository.Crosschecks update outdated RMAN repository information about backups whose repository records do not match their physical status. For example, if a user removes archived logs from disk with an operating system command, the repository still indicates that the logs are on disk, when in fact they are not.After connecting to the target database and recovery catalog (if you use one), run CROSSCHECK commands as needed to verify the status and availability of backups known to RMAN.You can use the LIST command to report your backups and then use the CROSSCHECK command to check that specific backups described in the LIST output still exist. Use the CROSSCHECK command to verify the status and availability of preplugin backups and preplugin archived redo log files known to RMAN.RMAN provides multiple methods of changing the repository status of backups and copies.Run the CHANGE...UNAVAILABLE command when a backup cannot be found or has migrated offsite.You can designate backups as exempt from the retention policy. This technique is useful for archiving backups to comply with business requirements.Use the CHANGE command with the GUID option to change the status of backups that correspond to pluggable databases (PDBs) that have been dropped from a multitenant container database (CDB).Use the CHANGE command to modify the repository status of preplugin backups and preplugin archived redo log files.You can use the CATALOG command to make RMAN aware of the existence of archived logs not recorded in the repository or copies of database files that are created through means other than RMAN. The target database control file keeps records of all archived redo logs generated by the target database and all RMAN backups. The purpose of the CATALOG command is to add metadata to the repository when it does not have a record of files for RMAN to manage.Use the CATALOG command to propagate information about user-managed copies to the RMAN repository. After the files are cataloged, you can run the LIST command or query V$BACKUP_FILES view to confirm the information is contained in the RMAN repository.You can catalog backup pieces on disk. This technique is useful if you use an operating system utility to copy backup pieces from one location to another on the same host, or from one host to another. If you use Automatic Storage Management (ASM), an Oracle Managed Files framework, or the fast recovery area, then you may want to recatalog files that are known to the disk management system but are no longer listed in the RMAN repository. This situation can occur when the intended mechanism for tracking file names fails due to media failure, software bug, or user error.Use the CATALOG command to add preplugin archived redo log files to the RMAN repository.You can remove records for files from the RMAN repository.You can use the CHANGE ... UNCATALOG command to update the RMAN repository for the absent files.You can use the RMAN DELETE command to delete archived redo logs and RMAN backups. Every RMAN backup produces a corresponding record in the RMAN repository. This record is stored in the control file. If a recovery catalog is used, then the record can also be found in the recovery catalog after the recovery catalog is resynchronized from the control file. You can delete backups and recovery catalog records for backups.The recommended maintenance strategy is to configure a fast recovery area, a backup retention policy, and an archived redo log deletion policy.Use the RMAN DELETE command to delete backups and image copies.You can use both the DELETE and BACKUP ... DELETE commands to delete specific backups and copies.You can use BACKUP ... DELETE to back up archived redo logs, data file copies, or backup sets and then delete the input files after successfully backing them up. If you run CROSSCHECK, and if RMAN cannot locate the files, then it updates their records in the RMAN repository to EXPIRED status. You can then use the DELETE EXPIRED command to remove records of expired backups and copies from the RMAN repository.The RMAN DELETE command supports an OBSOLETE option, which deletes backups that are no longer needed to satisfy specified recoverability requirements. Use the DELETE command with the GUID option to delete backups of pluggable databases (PDBs) that have been dropped from a multitenant container database (CDB).Use the DELETE command to delete preplugin backups and prelplugin archived redo log files.To remove a database from the operating system, you can use the DROP DATABASE command in RMAN. RMAN removes the server parameter file, all data files, online redo logs, and control files belonging to the target database."> Maintaining RMAN Backups and Repository&nbsp;Records</a>to learn how to manage the RMAN repository as stored in the control file, without a recovery catalog

                     <p>A recovery catalog is a database schema used by RMAN to store metadata about one or more Oracle databases. Typically, you store the catalog in a dedicated database.</p>
                     <p>A recovery catalog provides the following benefits:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>A recovery catalog creates redundancy for the RMAN repository stored in the control file of each <a href="glossary.html#GUID-272C4366-303F-4629-9679-1379AAC3FBC1"><span class="xrefglossterm">target database</span></a>. The recovery catalog serves as a secondary metadata repository. If the target control file and all backups are lost, then the RMAN metadata still exists in the recovery catalog. 
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>A recovery catalog centralizes metadata for all your target databases. Storing the metadata in a single place makes reporting and administration tasks easier to perform.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>A recovery catalog can store metadata history much longer than the control file. This capability is useful if you must do a recovery that goes further back in time than the history in the control file. The added complexity of managing a recovery catalog database can be offset by the convenience of having the extended backup history available.</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Some RMAN features function only when you use a recovery catalog. For example, you can store RMAN scripts in a recovery catalog. The chief advantage of a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-6A46F2BF-D1BF-4993-89BC-52A0AEC9370C"><span class="xrefglossterm">stored script</span></a> is that it is available to any RMAN client that can connect to the target database and recovery catalog. Command files are only available if the RMAN client has access to the file system on which they are stored.
                     </p>
                     <p>A recovery catalog is required when you use RMAN in a Data Guard environment. By storing backup metadata for all primary and standby databases, the catalog enables you to offload backup tasks to one standby database while enabling you to restore backups on other databases in the environment.</p>

You can determine which data files need backups or which files were not backed up recently. Also, you can preview which backups RMAN must restore if a problem occurs.RMAN stores metadata of every database on which it performs operations.In a Data Guard environment, you can use the LIST, REPORT, and SHOW commands just as you can when not using Data Guard. You can run these commands with the FOR DB_UNIQUE_NAME clause to show the backups associated with a specified database. The LIST command uses the information in the RMAN repository to provide lists of backups and other objects relating to backup and recovery. The primary purpose of the LIST command is to list backup and copies. Specify the desired objects with the listObjList or recordSpec clause. If you do not specify an object, then RMAN displays copies of all database files and archived redo log files.You can specify several different conditions to narrow your LIST output.Use the LIST command to list preplugin backups and preplugin archived redo log files.Each time an OPEN RESETLOGS operation is performed on a database, this operation creates a new incarnation of the database.The RMAN REPORT command analyzes the available backups and your database. The REPORT command provides various reports of RMAN backups.Use the REPORT NEED BACKUP command to determine which database files need backup under a specific retention policy. You can use options of the REPORT NEED BACKUP command to specify different retention policies.The REPORT NEED BACKUP command can check the entire database, skip specified tablespaces, or check only specific tablespaces or data files against different retention policies.You can limit the backups tested by the REPORT NEED BACKUP command to disk-based or tape-based backups only.When a data file has been changed by an unrecoverable operation, such as a direct load insert, normal media recovery cannot be used to recover the file, because an unrecoverable operation does not generate redo. You must perform either a full or incremental backup of affected data files after such operations, to ensure that data blocks affected by the unrecoverable operation can be recovered using RMAN.You can report backup sets, backup pieces, and data file copies that are obsolete that is, not needed to meet a specified retention policy by specifying the OBSOLETE keyword. The REPORT SCHEMA command lists and displays information about the database files, tablespaces, and so on. You can view reports on the metadata related to a multitenant container database (CDB), the root only, or one or more pluggable databases (PDBs). Use the LIST command with the GUID option to list backups of pluggable databases (PDBs) that have been dropped from a multitenant container database (CDB).In some cases, V$ views supply information that is not available through use of the LIST and REPORT commands. An RMAN job is the set of commands executed within an RMAN session. Thus, one RMAN job can contain multiple commands. The ENCRYPTED column of the V$BACKUP_PIECE and V$RMAN_BACKUP_PIECE views indicates whether a backup piece is encrypted (YES) or unencrypted (NO).The LIST, REPORT, and SHOW commands provide the easiest means of accessing the data in the control file and the recovery catalog. RMAN obtains backup and recovery metadata from a target database control file and stores it in the tables of the recovery catalog. The recovery catalog views are derived from these tables. The recovery catalog views are not normalized or optimized for user queries.Most recovery catalog views contain the columns DB_KEY and DBINC_KEY. Each database registered in the recovery catalog can be uniquely identified by either the primary key, which is the DB_KEY column value, or the DBID, which is the 32-bit unique database identifier. Each incarnation of a database is uniquely identified by the DBINC_KEY column.Special considerations apply when querying the recovery catalog in a Data Guard environment. The DB_KEY value, which is the primary key for a registered database, is used only in the recovery catalog. The easiest way is to obtain the DB_KEY is to use the DBID of the target database, which is displayed whenever you connect RMAN to a database as TARGET. You can query the view RC_BACKUP_FILES for information about all backups of any database registered in the recovery catalog. Before querying RC_BACKUP_FILES, however, you must call the DBMS_RCVMAN.SETDATABASE procedure.">Reporting on RMAN Operations</a>"</span> explains how to report on RMAN operations

                     <div>
                        <p>You must allocate space to be used by the catalog schema. The size of the recovery catalog schema depends upon the number of databases monitored by the catalog. </p>
                        <p>The schema also grows as the number of archived redo log files and backups for each database increases. Finally, if you use RMAN stored scripts stored in the catalog, some space must be allocated for those scripts.</p>
                        <p>For example, assume that the <code class="codeph">trgt</code> database has 100 files, and that you back up the database once a day, producing 50 backup sets containing 1 backup piece each. If you assume that each row in the backup piece table uses the maximum amount of space, then one daily backup consumes less than 170 kilobytes in the recovery catalog. So, if you back up once a day for a year, then the total storage in this period is about 62 megabytes. Assume approximately the same amount for archived logs. Thus, the worst case is about 120 megabytes for a year for metadata storage. For a more typical case in which only a portion of the backup piece row space is used, 15 MB for each year is realistic. 
                        </p>
                        <p>If you plan to register multiple databases in your recovery catalog, then remember to add up the space required for each one based on the previous calculation to arrive at a total size for the default tablespace of the recovery catalog schema.</p>

                     <p>The process of enrolling of a target database in a recovery catalog is called registration.</p>
                     <p>If a target database is not registered in the recovery catalog, then RMAN cannot use the catalog to store metadata for operations on this database. You can still perform RMAN operations on an unregistered database: RMAN always stores its metadata in the control file of the target database.</p>
                     <p>If you are <span class="italic">not </span>using the recovery catalog in a Data Guard environment, then use the <code class="codeph">REGISTER</code> command to register each database. Each database must have a unique <a href="glossary.html#GUID-2ABBEADC-F98C-4CF9-AD5B-065337E2733B"><span class="xrefglossterm">DBID</span></a>. If you use the RMAN <code class="codeph">DUPLICATE</code> command or the <code class="codeph">CREATE DATABASE</code> statement in SQL, then the database is assigned a unique DBID automatically. If you create a database by other means, then the copied database may have the same DBID as its source database. You can change the DBID with the <code class="codeph">DBNEWID</code> utility so that you can register the source and copy databases in the same catalog.
                     </p>
                     <p>You can use the <code class="codeph">UNREGISTER</code> command to unregister a database from the recovery catalog.

                        <p>In a Data Guard environment, the primary and standby databases share the same DBID and database name.

                        <p>The <code class="codeph">DB_UNIQUE_NAME</code> parameter for a database is set in its initialization parameter file. If you use RMAN in a Data Guard environment, then you can use the <code class="codeph">REGISTER DATABASE</code> command only for the primary database.

                        <p>You can use the following techniques to register a standby database in the recovery catalog:</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>If you have data file copies, backup pieces, or archived logs on disk, then you can catalog them in the recovery catalog with the <code class="codeph">CATALOG</code> command. When using a recovery catalog, cataloging older backups that have aged out of the control file lets RMAN use the older backups during restore operations. 
                  </p>
                  <div class="section">
                     <p>The following commands illustrate this technique:</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CATALOG DATAFILECOPY '/disk1/old_datafiles/01_01_2003/users01.dbf';
CATALOG ARCHIVELOG '/disk1/arch_logs/archive1_731.dbf', 
                   '/disk1/arch_logs/archive1_732.dbf';
CATALOG BACKUPPIECE '/disk1/backups/backup_820.bkp';</code></pre><p>You can also catalog multiple backup files in a directory by using the <code class="codeph">CATALOG START WITH</code> command, as shown in the following example:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CATALOG START WITH '/disk1/backups/';
</code></pre><p>RMAN lists the files to be added to the RMAN repository and prompts for confirmation before adding the backups. Be careful when creating your prefix with <code class="codeph">CATALOG START WITH</code>. RMAN scans all paths for all files on disk that begin with the specified prefix. The prefix is not just a directory name. Using the wrong prefix can cause the cataloging of the wrong set of files. 
                     </p>
                     <p>For example, assume that a group of directories <code>/disk1/backups</code>, <code>/disk1/backups-year2003</code>, <code>/disk1/backupsets</code>, <code>/disk1/backupsets/test</code> and so on, all contain backup files. The following command catalogs all files in all of these directories, because <code>/disk1/backups</code> is a prefix for the paths for all of these directories:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CATALOG START WITH '/disk1/backups';
</code></pre><p>To catalog only backups in the <code class="codeph">/disk1/backups</code> directory, the correct command is as follows:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CATALOG START WITH '/disk1/backups/';</code></pre><div class="infoboxnotealso" id="GUID-C2DE2E5D-DCDA-4A85-BA4D-A783180C4F51__GUID-89F35FE2-EEC2-4418-A2F0-708E280C720A">

                  <div>
                     <p>By default, all of the users of an RMAN recovery catalog have full privileges to read, select, insert, update, and delete any metadata in the catalog. For example, if the administrators of two unrelated databases share the same recovery catalog, each administrator could, whether inadvertently or maliciously, destroy catalog data for the other's database. In many enterprises, this situation is tolerated because the same people manage many different databases and also manage the recovery catalog. But in other enterprises where clear separation of duty exists between administrators of various databases, and between the DBA and the administrator of the recovery catalog, you may desire to restrict each database administrator to modify only backup metadata belonging to those databases that they are responsible for, while still keeping the benefits of a single, centrally-managed, RMAN recovery catalog. This goal can be achieved by implementing <a href="glossary.html#GUID-3ACE1C6A-AEA0-4F3A-973B-2308E0A5AD4B"><span class="xrefglossterm">virtual private catalog</span></a>s.
                     </p>
                     <p>Every RMAN recovery catalog starting with Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span> supports virtual private catalogs, but they are not used unless explicitly created. There is no restriction on the number of virtual private catalogs that can be created beneath one recovery catalog. Each virtual private catalog is owned by a database schema user which is different than the user who owns the recovery catalog. 
                     </p>
                     <p>After you set up a virtual private catalog user, the administrator for the recovery catalog grants each virtual private catalog the privilege to use that catalog for one or more databases that are currently registered in the recovery catalog. The administrator of the recovery catalog can also grant the privilege to register new databases while using a virtual private catalog.</p>

                        <p>The recovery catalog database is a database like any other, and is also a key part of your backup and recovery strategy. Protect the recovery catalog like any other part of your database, by backing it up. The backup strategy for your recovery catalog database is part of an overall backup and recovery strategy.</p>
                        <p>Back up the recovery catalog with the same frequency that you back up a target database. For example, if you make a weekly whole database backup of a target database, then back up the recovery catalog after the backup of the target database. This backup of the recovery catalog can help you in a disaster recovery scenario.

                        <p>A recovery catalog is only effective when separated from the data that it is designed to protect. Thus, you must never store a recovery catalog containing the RMAN repository for a database in the same database as the target database. Also, do not store the catalog database on the same disks as the target database.</p>
                        <p>To illustrate why data separation is advised, assume that you store the catalog for database <code class="codeph">prod1</code> in <code class="codeph">prod1</code>. If <code class="codeph">prod1</code> suffers a total media failure, and if the recovery catalog for <code class="codeph">prod1</code> is also stored in <code class="codeph">prod1</code>, then if you lose the database you also lose the recovery catalog. At this point the only option is to restore an autobackup of the control file for <code class="codeph">prod1</code> and use it to restore and recover the database without the benefit of any information stored in the recovery catalog.

                  <div>
                     <p>You can use a stored script as an alternative to a command file for managing frequently used sequences of RMAN commands. The script is stored in the recovery catalog rather than on the file system.</p>
                     <p>Stored scripts can be local or global. A local script is associated with the target database to which RMAN is connected when the script is created, and can only be executed when you are connected to that target database. A global stored script can be run against any database registered in the recovery catalog, if the RMAN client is connected to the recovery catalog and a target database.</p>
                     <p>The commands allowable within the brackets of the <code class="codeph">CREATE SCRIPT</code> command are the same commands supported within a <code class="codeph">RUN</code> block. Any command that is legal within a <code class="codeph">RUN</code> command is permitted in the stored script. The following commands are not legal within stored scripts: <code class="codeph">RUN</code>, <code class="codeph">@</code>, and <code class="codeph">@@</code>.
                     </p>
                     <p>When specifying a script name, RMAN permits but generally does not require that you use quotes around the name of a stored script. If the name begins with a digit or is an RMAN reserved word, however, then you must put quotes around the name to use it as a stored script name. Consider avoiding stored script names that begin with nonalphabetic characters or that are the same as RMAN reserved words.</p>
                     <p>Consider using a naming convention to avoid confusion between global and local stored scripts. For the <code class="codeph">EXECUTE SCRIPT</code>, <code class="codeph">DELETE SCRIPT</code> and <code class="codeph">PRINT SCRIPT</code> commands, if the script name passed as an argument is not the name of a script defined for the connected target instance, then RMAN looks for a global script by the same name. For example, if the global script <code class="codeph">global_backup</code> is in the recovery catalog, but no local stored script <code class="codeph">global_backup </code>is defined for the target database, then the following command deletes the global script:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>DELETE SCRIPT global_backup;
</code></pre><p>To use commands related to stored scripts, even global scripts, you must be connected to both a recovery catalog and a target database instance.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>After you have created a recovery catalog and registered your target databases, you must maintain this catalog.</p>
                     <p>For example, you must run the <a href="glossary.html#GUID-F89B6EF7-3067-45B0-A45C-DE5247E0C326"><span class="xrefglossterm">RMAN maintenance commands</span></a>, which are explained in <span class="q">"<a href="maintaining-rman-backups.html#GUID-F5C3D045-279B-4AB3-8A91-3231A716402C" title="The recommended maintenance strategy is to configure a fast recovery area, a backup retention policy, and an archived redo log deletion policy. In this case, the database automatically maintains and deletes backups and archived redo logs as needed. However, manual maintenance of database backups and archived redo logs is sometimes necessary.RMAN provides multiple commands to maintain RMAN backups and repository records.RMAN always stores its metadata in the control file of each target database on which it performs operations. If you register a target database in the recovery catalog, then RMAN stores the metadata for this target database in the recovery catalog. The database in a Data Guard environment that creates a backup or copy is associated with the file. For example, if RMAN is connected to target database standby1 and backs it up, then this backup is associated with standby1.For a crosscheck, RMAN can only update the status of a file from AVAILABLE to EXPIRED when connected to the database associated with the file. RMAN can delete files when connected to any database. If RMAN is not connected as TARGET to the database associated with a file, and if RMAN cannot delete a file successfully, then RMAN prompts you to connect as TARGET to the database associated with the file. You must then use DELETE ... FORCE to delete the file metadata.If a maintenance command changes RMAN metadata only, then you can connect RMAN as TARGET to any database in the Data Guard environment. A backup remains associated with a database unless you explicitly use the CHANGE ... RESET DB_UNIQUE_NAME to associate the backup with a different database.RMAN is designed to work without a recovery catalog. If you choose not to use a recovery catalog, however, then the control file of each target database is the exclusive repository for RMAN metadata.The control file contains two types of records: circular reuse records and noncircular reuse records.When a control file record containing information about a file created in the fast recovery area is about to be reused, the database attempts to delete the file from the fast recovery area when the file is eligible for deletion. Otherwise, the database expands the size of the control file section containing the record for this file.The best way to prevent the loss of RMAN metadata because of overwritten control file records is to use a recovery catalog.If you are not using a recovery catalog to store RMAN metadata, then it is doubly important that you protect each target database control file.Although the fast recovery area is largely self-managing, some situations may require database administration intervention.RMAN uses certain rules to determine when files can be deleted from the fast recovery area.You can use the V$RECOVERY_FILE_DEST and V$RECOVERY_AREA_USAGE views to determine whether you have allocated enough space for your fast recovery area.You cannot manage the flashback logs in the fast recovery area directly other than by setting the flashback retention target or using guaranteed restore points.If the RMAN retention policy requires keeping a set of backups larger than the fast recovery area disk quota, or if the retention policy is set to NONE, then the fast recovery area can fill completely with no reclaimable space.Use the ALTER SYSTEM command to change the location of the fast recovery area.The ALTER SYSTEM command can be used to disable the fast recovery area.As a rule, the fast recovery area is self-maintaining. When an instance crashes during the creation of a file in the fast recovery area, however, the database may leave the file in the fast recovery area.Several situations can cause a discrepancy between the repository and the files that it records, including tape or disk failures and user-managed copies or deletions of RMAN-related files.To ensure that data about backups in the recovery catalog or control file is synchronized with corresponding data on disk or in the media management catalog, perform a crosscheck. The CROSSCHECK command operates only on files that are currently recorded in the RMAN repository.Crosschecks update outdated RMAN repository information about backups whose repository records do not match their physical status. For example, if a user removes archived logs from disk with an operating system command, the repository still indicates that the logs are on disk, when in fact they are not.After connecting to the target database and recovery catalog (if you use one), run CROSSCHECK commands as needed to verify the status and availability of backups known to RMAN.You can use the LIST command to report your backups and then use the CROSSCHECK command to check that specific backups described in the LIST output still exist. Use the CROSSCHECK command to verify the status and availability of preplugin backups and preplugin archived redo log files known to RMAN.RMAN provides multiple methods of changing the repository status of backups and copies.Run the CHANGE...UNAVAILABLE command when a backup cannot be found or has migrated offsite.You can designate backups as exempt from the retention policy. This technique is useful for archiving backups to comply with business requirements.Use the CHANGE command with the GUID option to change the status of backups that correspond to pluggable databases (PDBs) that have been dropped from a multitenant container database (CDB).Use the CHANGE command to modify the repository status of preplugin backups and preplugin archived redo log files.You can use the CATALOG command to make RMAN aware of the existence of archived logs not recorded in the repository or copies of database files that are created through means other than RMAN. The target database control file keeps records of all archived redo logs generated by the target database and all RMAN backups. The purpose of the CATALOG command is to add metadata to the repository when it does not have a record of files for RMAN to manage.Use the CATALOG command to propagate information about user-managed copies to the RMAN repository. After the files are cataloged, you can run the LIST command or query V$BACKUP_FILES view to confirm the information is contained in the RMAN repository.You can catalog backup pieces on disk. This technique is useful if you use an operating system utility to copy backup pieces from one location to another on the same host, or from one host to another. If you use Automatic Storage Management (ASM), an Oracle Managed Files framework, or the fast recovery area, then you may want to recatalog files that are known to the disk management system but are no longer listed in the RMAN repository. This situation can occur when the intended mechanism for tracking file names fails due to media failure, software bug, or user error.Use the CATALOG command to add preplugin archived redo log files to the RMAN repository.You can remove records for files from the RMAN repository.You can use the CHANGE ... UNCATALOG command to update the RMAN repository for the absent files.You can use the RMAN DELETE command to delete archived redo logs and RMAN backups. Every RMAN backup produces a corresponding record in the RMAN repository. This record is stored in the control file. If a recovery catalog is used, then the record can also be found in the recovery catalog after the recovery catalog is resynchronized from the control file. You can delete backups and recovery catalog records for backups.The recommended maintenance strategy is to configure a fast recovery area, a backup retention policy, and an archived redo log deletion policy.Use the RMAN DELETE command to delete backups and image copies.You can use both the DELETE and BACKUP ... DELETE commands to delete specific backups and copies.You can use BACKUP ... DELETE to back up archived redo logs, data file copies, or backup sets and then delete the input files after successfully backing them up. If you run CROSSCHECK, and if RMAN cannot locate the files, then it updates their records in the RMAN repository to EXPIRED status. You can then use the DELETE EXPIRED command to remove records of expired backups and copies from the RMAN repository.The RMAN DELETE command supports an OBSOLETE option, which deletes backups that are no longer needed to satisfy specified recoverability requirements. Use the DELETE command with the GUID option to delete backups of pluggable databases (PDBs) that have been dropped from a multitenant container database (CDB).Use the DELETE command to delete preplugin backups and prelplugin archived redo log files.To remove a database from the operating system, you can use the DROP DATABASE command in RMAN. RMAN removes the server parameter file, all data files, online redo logs, and control files belonging to the target database.">Maintaining RMAN Backups and Repository&nbsp;Records</a>"</span>, to update backup records and to delete backups that are no longer needed. You must perform this type of maintenance regardless of whether you use RMAN with a recovery catalog. Other types of maintenance, such as upgrading a recovery catalog schema, are specific to use of RMAN with a recovery catalog.

                        <p>In a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-ABC68132-29E7-43AA-A03C-2DAC11B7C91D"><span class="xrefglossterm">full resynchronization</span></a>, RMAN updates all changed records, including those for the database schema. RMAN performs a full resynchronization after structural changes to database (adding or dropping database files, creating new incarnation, and so on) or after changes to the RMAN persistent configuration.
                        </p>
                        <p>RMAN creates a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-C49B814B-6834-4CC0-911D-60F7CA87669F"><span class="xrefglossterm">snapshot control file</span></a>, which is a temporary backup control file, when it performs a full resynchronization. The database ensures that only one RMAN session accesses a snapshot control file at any point in time. RMAN creates the snapshot control file in an operating system-specific location on the target database host. You can specify the name and location of the snapshot control file, as explained in <span class="q">"<a href="configuring-rman-client-advanced.html#GUID-B7B61600-6DED-413D-B134-1DAE79627A01" title="When RMAN needs a read-consistent version of the control file, it creates a temporary snapshot control file.

                        <p>This snapshot control file ensures that RMAN has a consistent view of the control file.

                           <p>RMAN only automatically resynchronizes the recovery catalog with a database when connected to this database as <code class="codeph">TARGET</code>. Thus, RMAN does not automatically resynchronize every database in a Data Guard environment when connected as <code class="codeph">TARGET</code> to one database in the environment.
                           </p>
                           <p>You can use the <code class="codeph">RESYNC CATALOG FROM DB_UNIQUE_NAME</code> command to manually resynchronize the recovery catalog with a database in the Data Guard environment. 
                           </p>
                           <p>For an example of a manual resynchronization, assume that RMAN is connected as <code class="codeph">TARGET</code> to production database <code class="codeph">prod</code>, and that you have used <code class="codeph">CONFIGURE</code> to create a configuration for <code class="codeph">dgprod3</code>. If you run <code class="codeph">RESYNC CATALOG FROM DB_UNIQUE_NAME dgprod3</code>, then RMAN resynchronizes the recovery catalog with the <code class="codeph">dgprod3</code> control file. In this case RMAN performs both a normal resynchronization, in which metadata flows from the <code class="codeph">dgprod3</code> control file to the catalog, and a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-52C89ABD-D7C1-4FE1-9825-BCBF1973B156"><span class="xrefglossterm">reverse resynchronization</span></a>. In a reverse resynchronization, RMAN uses the persistent configurations in the recovery catalog to update the <code class="codeph">dgprod3</code> control file.

                           <p>In this case, you may want to manually resynchronize the recovery catalog regularly because the recovery catalog is <span class="italic">not</span> updated automatically when a redo log switch occurs or when a redo log is archived.

                           <p>How frequently you must resynchronize the recovery catalog depends on the rate at which the database archives redo logs. The cost of the operation is proportional to the number of records in the control file that have been inserted or changed since the previous resynchronization. If no records have been inserted or changed, then the cost of resynchronization is very low; if many records have been inserted or changed, then the resynchronization is more time-consuming.</p>

                        <p>If you use a version of the recovery catalog schema that is older than that required by the RMAN client, then you must upgrade it. The compatibility matrix in <a href="../rcmrf/rman-compatibility.html#RCMRF005" target="_blank"><span><cite>Oracle Database Backup and Recovery Reference</cite></span></a> explains which schema versions are compatible with which versions of RMAN. For example, you must upgrade the catalog if you use an Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span> RMAN client with a release 10.2 version of the recovery catalog schema.

                           <p>Assume that you upgrade the recovery catalog schema to Oracle Database 11<span class="italic">g</span> or later in a Data Guard environment. When RMAN connects to a standby database, it automatically registers the new database information and resynchronizes to obtain the file names from the control file.
                           </p>
                           <p>During the resynchronization, RMAN associates the names with the target database name. Because the recovery catalog contains historical metadata, some records in the catalog are not known to the control file. For example, the <code class="codeph">standby1</code> control file does not know about all backups made on <code class="codeph">primary1</code>. The database unique name for these old records is <code class="codeph">null</code>. As explained in <span class="q">"<a href="managing-recovery-catalog.html#GUID-6B077FE7-8E10-4603-8FDB-CAE3357E85C9" title="After you have created a recovery catalog and registered your target databases, you must maintain this catalog.">About Recovery Catalog Maintenance</a>"</span>, you can use <code class="codeph">CROSSCHECK</code> to fix these records.

                        <p>A target database, recovery catalog database, and recovery catalog schema can be at different database versions. The recommended practice is to import all existing recovery catalogs into a single recovery catalog at the latest version of the recovery catalog schema. </p>
