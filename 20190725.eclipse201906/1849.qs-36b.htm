<h1>The Search view</h1>

<p>Now that the search for &quot;it&quot; has been completed, the Search view 
  is visible. The title of the Search view shows that four matches were found.&nbsp;</p>
<blockquote> 
  <p> <img src="../images/Image51_search_view.png"  alt="Search view. Four matches for the word it found in the Workspace." border="0">&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
</blockquote>
<p CLASS="Head"> Within the Search view two files are shown and within each file 
  there were 2 matches found.&nbsp; </p>
    <ol>
  <li>Click the Show Next Match button <img src="../images/Image51_search_next.png"  alt="Show next match button" border="0"> to 
    navigate to the first match of the search expression (&quot;it&quot;). <br>
    Notice that the file JanesFile.txt is automatically selected and opened in 
    the editor area. <br>
    Click Show Next Match button two more times. Once again the Search view automatically 
    opens the file (JanesText.txt).</li>
  <li>It is sometimes useful to remove uninteresting matches from the search results. 
    The Search view's popup menu allows you to do this using <b>Remove Selected 
    Matches</b> which removes any selected file entries (and all matches in them) 
    from the Search view. Note that this <strong>only</strong> removes the entries 
    in the Search view, it does <strong>not</strong> affect the files themselves. 
    Select JanesFile.txt and choose <b>Remove Selected Matches</b> from the popup 
    menu. The Search view now shows only the matches for JanesText.txt.

    </p>
  </li>
  <li>Perform a second search for &quot;that&quot; by clicking on the Search button 
    <img src="../images/Image50_search.png"  alt="Search button" border="0"> in 
    the Workbench's toolbar.</li>
  <li>The Search view updates to show the results of the new search. <br>
    Use the drop down button on the Search view's toolbar to move back and forth 
    between the two search results.
    <p>
    	<img src="../images/Image51_search_switching.png"  alt="Search view. Drop down button." border="0">
    </p>
  </li>
  <li>In the drop down button choose <b>'it' - 1 match in workspace</b>. The Search 
    view switches back to show the original search. On the context menu choose 
    <b>Search Again</b> to repeat the initial search. Notice that once again there 
    are four matches.</li>
</ol>
<p>So far you have seen how to manage your search results and how to switch between
different searches. However, it might happen that you do not want the search view to 
change even if further searches are performed. For this you can <strong>pin</strong> 
the search view, which causes subsequent searches to be shown in a second Search 
view.</p>
