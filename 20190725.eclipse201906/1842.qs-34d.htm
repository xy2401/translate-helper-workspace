<h1>Editing files outside the Workbench</h1>

<P CLASS="Para"> In a previous section an external editor was launched on the 
  file JanesINIFile.ini by double clicking on it in the Project Explorer. The same external 
  editor can also be used by launching it outside of the Workbench.&nbsp;</P>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Close any editors that are open on JanesINIFile.ini.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the file system explorer, navigate to the directory where 
      the Workbench was installed and go into the workspace sub-directory.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Edit the file JanesINIFile.ini and save it . Do not use the 
      Workbench's Project Explorer to open the editor.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Return to the Workbench and in the Project Explorer view, select 
      the project JaneQUser.&nbsp;</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Choose <b>Refresh</b> from the project's context menu. This 
      instructs the Workbench to look for any changes to the project that have 
      been made in the local file system by external tools.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Select the file JanesINIFile.ini.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para"> For a little variety choose <b>Open With &gt; Text Editor</b> 
      from the file's popup menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Observe that the Workbench's own default text editor is opened.&nbsp;</P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the default text editor verify that the externally made 
      changes are reflected in the Workbench.</P>
  </li>
</ol>
<P>The Workbench stores all of its resources in the local file system. This means 
  the system file explorer can be used to copy files from the Workbench's workspace 
  area even when the Workbench is not running. Resources can also be copied into 
  the workspace directory. Use Refresh to update the Workbench with any changes 
  made outside the Workbench.&nbsp; &nbsp; </P>
