<h1 class="Head">Quick Diff: Showing changes in a text editor</h1>
<p>Instead of using a compare editor, which will show changes between 2
or
3 files by showing each file side-by-side, you can enable quick diff
support and see the changes within the text editor (e.g. any text
editor based on the Eclipse text editor). This feature can be enabled
via the
<a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.ui.editors.preferencePages.QuickDiff)")'>
<img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link">
<span style="font-weight: bold;">General &gt; Editors &gt; Text Editors &gt; Quick Diff</span></a>
preference page. You should select the
<span style="font-weight: bold;">Latest CVS Revision</span> as the reference
source. This will annotate the text file with diffs against the
latest revision in CVS. Here are the following scenarios that are
useful:</p>
<ol>
  <li>
    <p><span>Open a file and make changes to it. You will see the
difference <span>annotations marking the changes. Then if you run <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Team &gt; Replace with latest</span>. The
annotations are removed and the file is clean. </span></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span>Open a file and make changes to it. You will see the
difference <span>annotations marking the changes. Then if you run <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">Team &gt; Commit</span> the annotations are
removed and the file is clean.</span></span></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><span><span>If you synchronize the file with the server and a new revision 
      is found on the server, the editor will update showing the incoming changes.</span></span></p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>If you enable showing the differences in the overview ruler, you can, at a 
  glance, get an idea of how many changes you have made to a file since your last 
  commit. The differencing happens in a background thread to minimize the impact 
  on actual editing of the file.</p>
<p><em>Note:</em> this feature requires an active 
  connection to your CVS server so that remote contents can be fetched when an 
  editor is opened.</p>
