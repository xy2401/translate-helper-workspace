<h1>Configuration Tab</h1>
<p>The <strong>Configuration Tab</strong> is an advanced tab that lets you override the default configuration area location and the <em>config.ini</em> file content of the runtime Eclipse application you are testing. </p>
<h1><img src="../../images/launchers/launcher_eclipse_configuration.png" alt="Configuration tab" > </h1>

<h2>Configuration Area</h2>
<p>Every Eclipse application instance has a unique configuration area which contains metadata, caches and configuration files read by the runtime on startup.</p>
<p>Typically, the location of the configuration is not important; therefore, PDE generates a unique configuration area for every launch in its own metadata area. This configuration area is deleted when the launch configuration is deleted.</p>
<p>If desired, a user can set the location of the configuration area. Variables in the directory path are supported; thus, allowing launch configurations to be sharable among team members.</p>
<p>There is also an option to <strong>Clear the configuration area before launching</strong>, which is useful for testing how plug-ins cache data in that area. </p>

<h2>Configuration File</h2>
<p> Upon startup, the runtime reads a configuration file named <em>config.ini</em> located in a <em>configuration/</em> subdirectory of the configuration area associated with the Eclipse application instance. This file is a standard properties file that can configure many aspects of the runtime. For a full list of the supported properties, refer to the <a href="../../../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.isv/reference/misc/runtime-options.html">Eclipse runtime options</a> document.</p>
<p>The <strong>Generate a config.ini file with default content</strong> is the default option and is recommended unless you have some very specific needs.  When this option is selected, PDE generates a <em>config.ini</em> file with the following properties:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>osgi.bundles</strong> - lists all the bundles that should be installed and optionally started once the system is up and running. This list is based on the <em>osgi.bundles</em> key found in the <em>${target_home}/configuration/config.ini</em> file.  (Note, the ${target_home} variable is the location of the target platform).</li>
  <li><strong>osgi.bundles.defaultStartLevel</strong> - denotes the default OSGi start level at which a bundle should start.  The default value is set to <strong>4</strong></li>
  <li><strong>osgi.configuration.cascaded</strong> - indicates whether this configuration is standalone or has a parent configuration to cascade up to.  The default value is set to false.</li>
  <li><strong>osgi.framework</strong> - specifies the URL location of the <em>org.eclipse.osgi</em> plug-in</li>
  <li><strong>osgi.install.area</strong> - specifies the location of the target platform. </li>
  <li><strong>osgi.splashPath</strong> - specifies one or more locations of the splash screen.</li>
</ul>
<p>The <strong>Use an existing <em>config.ini</em> file as a template</strong> option takes an existing <em>config.ini</em> file and makes a copy of it. PDE neither adds nor removes properties from this file. However, PDE modifies the <strong>osgi.bundles</strong> and <strong>osgi.splashPath</strong> keys by substituting their generic bundle URL values with absolute paths that reflect the actual locations of the bundles on disk.</p>

<h2>Software Installation</h2>
<p>Use <strong>Support software installation in the launched application</strong> to create p2 metadata for the plug-ins
being launched and starts the application with a profile containing the metadata.  If the launched application does
not include p2, this option has no effect.  The contents of the profile are cleared and recreated on each launch,
but if the application is restarted the same profile is kept.</p>
