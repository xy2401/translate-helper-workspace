<h1>Drag and drop or copy and paste</h1>

<P CLASS="Para"> 
  On some platforms, for example on macOS and Microsoft Windows,
  the operating system's file system browser can be used to copy folders and files 
  from the file system into the Workbench.</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> <strong>Note: </strong>The resource(s) must be dragged to the 
  exact location in the hierarchy of one of the navigation views where the resources 
  are to reside; they cannot be simply dragged and dropped onto a blank area in 
  the navigation view.</P>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Open the operating system's file system explorer.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Locate the file JanesFile.txt that was recently exported 
      and drag it to a specific location in one of the navigation views in the 
      Workbench.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> A dialog appears that allows to determine how the file will be
    added to the project, either as a simple copy of the original file or as a link file.</P>
	    <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image_file_operation.png"  alt="File and Folder Operation dialog" border="0"></P>
    <P CLASS="Para">When dragging resources into one of the navigation views, 
      the project/folder that the resource is being dropped into will be selected.</P>
        <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image37drop.png"  alt="Project Explorer view" border="0"></P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> Drag the file over JaneQUser2 and release the mouse button.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> Notice that the file is copied into the Workbench and placed 
      into JaneQUser2.</P>
  </li>
  <li>This can also be achieved by copying the file in the file system explorer, 
    then selecting the destination in the navigation view and choosing <b>Edit 
    &gt; Paste</b>. </li>
</ol>
<P CLASS="Para">Generally, files and folders can be imported in a project by making 
copies under the project folder, or by linking to the original files and folders by creating link files and folders.
When folders are drag and dropped (not only files), the dialog also allows you to create a project hierarchy with virtual folders.
A virtual folder is a folder hierarchy in the Workspace whose files are all links referring to the original file system location.</P>
