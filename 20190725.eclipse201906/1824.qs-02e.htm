<h1>Views</h1>

<P CLASS="Para">The primary use of Views is to provide navigation of the information
 in the Workbench. For example:</P>
<UL CLASS="UnorderedList">
<LI CLASS="Item">
The Bookmarks view displays all bookmarks in the Workbench along with the names
of the files with which the bookmarks are associated.</LI>
  <LI CLASS="Item"> The Project Explorer view displays the Workbench projects, their folders and files.</LI>
</UL>
<P CLASS="Para">
A view might appear by itself or stacked with other views in a tabbed notebook.&nbsp;&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
	<img src="../images/Image3_single.png"  alt="Task View" border="0">
</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> To activate a view that is part of a tabbed notebook simply click 
  its tab.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
	<img src="../images/Image3_tabbed.png" alt="Two views with tabs, project explorer view active" border="0">
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">Views have two menus. The first, which is accessed by right clicking on the
  view's tab, allows the view to be manipulated in much the 
  same manner as the menu associated with the Workbench window.</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
	<img src="../images/Image8_view.png" alt="Project Explorer view menu, top left" border="0">
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">The second menu, called the "view pull-down menu", is accessed by clicking the down arrow <img src="../images/Image9_viewdownarrow.png" alt="View down arrow" border="0" >. 
  The view pull-down menu typically contains operations that apply to the entire 
  contents of the view, but not to a specific item shown in the view. Operations 
  for sorting and filtering are commonly found in the view pull-down.&nbsp;</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
	<img src="../images/Image7_view_pulldown.png" alt="Project Explorer view menu, arrow pulldown" border="0">
</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> A view can be displayed by selecting it from the <b>Window &gt; 
  Show View</b> menu. A perspective determines which views may be required and 
  displays these on the <b>Show View</b> sub-menu. Additional views are available 
  by choosing
  <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.views.showView")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link">
  <b>Other...</b></a>
  at the bottom of the <b>Show View</b> sub-menu. This 
  is just one of the many features that provide for the creation of a custom work 
  environment. </P>
<P CLASS="Para">
	<img src="../images/Image4_showview.png" alt="Show View menu" border="0">
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">Through the normal course of using the Workbench you will open, move, resize, and close views.
  If you'd like to restore the perspective back to its original state, you can 
  select the <b>Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Reset Perspective</b> menu operation.</P>
