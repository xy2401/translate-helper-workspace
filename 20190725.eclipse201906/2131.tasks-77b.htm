<h1>Associating a task with a resource</h1>

<p>You can associate tasks with an editable resource, for instance
to remind yourself to update a line of source code later.
</p>

<ol>
  <li>In one of the navigation views, double-click the resource with which
      you wish to associate the new task. The resource opens in the editor area.</li>
  <li>Right-click in the gray border at the left of the editor
      area, beside the line of text or source code against which you want to log
      the new task.</li>
  <li>On the pop-up menu, select <b>Add Task</b>.</li>
  <li>When prompted, enter a brief description of the task.</li>
</ol>

<p>A new task icon appears in the border of the editor area, to
the left of the line where you added the task. When you move the mouse pointer
over the marker, the description of the task is displayed as a tooltip. The task
is also added to the Tasks view. You can delete a task either by right-clicking
its icon in the editor area and selecting <b>Remove Task</b>, or by pressing the 
Delete key in the Tasks view.
