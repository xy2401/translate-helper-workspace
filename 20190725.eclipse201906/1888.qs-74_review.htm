<h1>A quick review</h1>

<p> Here are some of the more important but subtle issues
associated with working in a repository . </p>
<ul>
  <li>The project was tagged as a version by versioning the project as
it appeared in the Workbench. For this reason it is important to
synchronize the project with the repository (that is the HEAD or the
branch that is being worked in) prior to versioning it. Otherwise
another user may have committed interesting changes to the project
which have yet to be updated in the Workbench. By proceeding to version
the project without updating, it will be versioned without these
changes.</li>
  <li>The repository contains all projects in the repository.
Individuals pick the projects they are interested in and check
them out into the workspace. From that point on they are synchronizing
those projects (only) with respect to the repository.</li>
  <li>The repository represents a large in-progress collection of all
known projects. From the repository's perspective, everything in HEAD
or on a branch is always open for change.</li>
  <li>The act of versioning a project effectively snapshots it and
places it into the Versions section of the repository, however the
repository branches are still open for change.</li>
  <li>It is important to first update to changes made to the
repository, retest with those changes and the soon to be committed
changes and then commit the changes. By first taking the latest
changes in the branch, and retesting, it helps to ensure that the
changes about to be committed will actually work with the current state
of the branch.</li>
  <li>Each project is associated with a specific repository. Different
projects can be associated with different repositories that may be on
completely different servers.</li>
</ul>
