<H1>Viewing a file's revision history</H1>

<P>Every time you commit a file to the CVS repository, a new revision is created. 
  Each revision is identified by a number (for example, 1.1 or 1.11.3.5). Along 
  with each revision is stored the author, the date, and a commit comment.
</P>

<P>To view the resource history for a file:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>Select the file in one of the navigation views. From the context menu, choose <b>Team 
    &gt; Show History</b>.</li>
  <li>The History view will open and show a history for the selected CVS
    file.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note:</em> The History view also shows you all version and branch 
  tags that are associated with the file.
</p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> You can show different types of revisions (your options are: Local and Remote
revisions, only Remote revisions or only Local revisions) by using the History 
view's mode toggle buttons. These toggle buttons are located on the History view toolbar. 
</p>

<p><em>Tip:</em> You can drag and drop a file from one of the navigation views into the History 
view instead of choosing the menu item.
</p>

<p><em>Tip</em>: You can have the History view update automatically 
  to the history of the file in the active editor by enabling the <strong>Link 
  with Editor</strong> item in the view's toolbar.</p>
