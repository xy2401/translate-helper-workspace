<H1>Tiling editors</H1>

<P>The Workbench allows you to have multiple files open in multiple editors. Unlike
views, editors cannot be dragged outside the Workbench to create new windows.
However, you can tile editor sessions within the editor area, in order to view
source files side by side.
</P>

<ol>
  <li>With two or more files open in the editor area, select one of the editor tabs.</li>
  <li>Holding down the left mouse button, drag that editor over
    the left, right, top or bottom border of the editor area. Notice that the
    mouse pointer changes to a &quot;drop cursor&quot; that indicates where the
    editor session will be moved when you release the mouse button.</li>
  <li>(Optional) Drag the borders of the editor area or each
    editor, to resize as desired.</li>
</ol>

<p>This is a similar operation to moving and docking views inside
the Workbench, except that all editor sessions must be contained within the
editor area.
