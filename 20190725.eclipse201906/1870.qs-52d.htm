<h1>Understanding the comparison</h1>

<p CLASS="Head">Comparing file1.txt and file2.txt resulted in the following
compare editor. The left side shows the contents of file1.txt and the right side
shows the contents of file2.txt. The lines connecting the left and right panes
indicate the differences between the files.</p>
<p CLASS="Head">If more room is needed to look at the comparison, the editor tab 
  can be double clicked to maximize the editor.&nbsp;</p>
<p CLASS="Head">
<img src="../images/Image80_compare_editor2.png" alt="Compare editor" border="0" >&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p CLASS="Head"> The numbered changes on the left side of the difference editor 
  are as follows:</p>
<ul>
  <li> Starting with the top line (in the left pane) the difference bar (in the 
    area of the blue circle) indicates something is missing from the very top 
    of the left file. Follow the difference band (see #1) to the right file. It 
    contains &quot;This is line 1&quot; .</li>
  <li> The next line &quot;This is line 2.&quot; is white indicating it matches 
    the right file.</li>
  <li> Moving onto the next line (colored in the background color), see that the 
    left file and right file have different contents for this line (see #2).</li>
  <li> The next line (This is line 4) is once again in white, so it can be skipped.</li>
  <li> The next line exists in the left file&nbsp; but since it is in the background 
    color its difference bar can be followed to the right (see #3) and notice 
    that the right file does not contain the line (see red circle).</li>
</ul>
<p CLASS="Head">Initially the compare editor might seem a bit daunting but when 
  simply working down the left side and focusing on the items marked as gray, 
  and those items missing from the left side, it turns out not to be as tricky 
  as it first seems.</p>
