<strong>General &gt; Workspace &gt; Linked Resources</strong></a>

preference page is used when working with 
<a href="../concepts/concepts-13.htm">linked resources</a>. The preference 
<b>Enable linked resources</b> is used to globally enable or disable the linked resource
feature for the entire workspace.  By default, linked resources are enabled. If you
disable linked resources, then you will not be able to create any new linked resources,
or import existing projects that contain linked resources.
</P>
<P CLASS="Para">
Not all versions of the workbench support linked resources and recognize them as such. 
You may not want to use linked resources if you plan to share your workspace data with 
other users. Disable this preference if they will not be able to work with linked resources.

</P>
<P CLASS="Para"> The remainder of this page is for defining <a href="../concepts/cpathvars.htm">path 
  variables</a> that are used when creating linked resources. Use the <b>New</b> 
  button to define new variables, the <b>Edit</b> button to change the value of 
  an existing variable, and the <b>Remove</b> button to get rid of an existing 
  variable. Note if you change a path variable that is currently in use, you will 
  need to perform a local refresh on those projects to &quot;discover&quot; what 
  is different in the file system. You can refresh a resource by opening the one 
  of the navigation views' context menu for that resource and selecting <b>Refresh</b>. 
  It is not recommended that you remove a path variable that is currently in use.
