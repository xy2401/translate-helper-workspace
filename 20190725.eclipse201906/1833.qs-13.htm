<h1>Files</h1>

<p CLASS="Para">The projects, folders and files that you create with the Workbench are
  all stored under a single directory that represents your workspace. The location of
  the workspace was set in the dialog that first opens when you start the Workbench.</p>
<p>If you have forgotten where that location is, you can find it by selecting
  <b>File &gt; Switch Workspace...</b>. The workspace directory will be displayed in
  the dialog that appears.
  <b>IMPORTANT:</b> After recording this location, hit <b>Cancel</b> to close the dialog,
  or the Workbench will exit and re-open on whatever workspace was selected.</p>
<p CLASS="Para">All of the projects, folders and files that you create with the 
  Workbench are stored as normal directories and files on the machine. This allows
  the use of other tools when working with the files. 
  Those tools can be completely oblivious to the Workbench. A later section will 
  look at how to work with external editors that are not integrated into the Workbench.</p>
