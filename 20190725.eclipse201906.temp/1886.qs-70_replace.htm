<h1> Replacing</h1>

<p>Suppose after further reflection, it becomes apparent
to Jane that the revision of <em class="FileName">file1.txt</em> that was just received is incorrect and
an earlier revision is required. A Workbench resource can be replaced
with an earlier revision of the resource from the repository. To roll
back to an earlier revision:</p>
<ol>
  <li class="Steps">In one of the navigation views select the <em class="FileName">file1.txt</em>.
  </li>
  <li class="Steps"> From the file's context menu, select <em class="UILabel">Replace With &gt; History....</em>
  </li>
  <li class="Steps">The history view will open and display the revisions available for the 
     selected file. Make sure that the history view is in Remote Revisions mode. (If it is not you can put it in
     Remote mode by clicking on the <em class="UILabel">Remote Revisions</em> button in the History view toolbar.) 
     Select revision <b>1.3</b> in the
     table and from the pop-up menu choose <em class="UILabel">Get Contents</em>.
     <img class="Big" src="../images/Image84_replace3.png"  alt="History View">
  </li>
  <li class="Steps">Observe that the navigation view updates to show the CVS state of a resource. 
      Notice that the modified file is preceded by "&gt;" indicating 
      that <em class="FileName">file1.txt</em> has changed (by replacing it with the earlier version).
      <img class="Big" src="../images/Image84_replace2.png"  alt="File selection">
  </li>
  <li class="Steps">Now assume that this older revision is not as good as it initially seemed 
    and in fact the revision in the repository is better after all.
    <p>Instead of choosing <em class="UILabel">Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</em>, choose 
      <em class="UILabel">Replace With &gt; Latest from HEAD</em>.</p>
    <p>Observe that <em class="FileName">file1.txt</em> is updated to have the same contents as the latest revision from the repository, 
      and that the leading indicator "&gt;" has been removed since it is now the 
      same revision as the repository. </p>
  </li>
</ol>
<p>Now that you have a file's revisions displayed in the History View, it is possible to compare revisions directly
  by selecting the revisions in the table and choosing <em class="UILabel">Compare With Each Other.</em></p>
