<h1>Comparing</h1>

<P CLASS="Para"> The Workbench allows for the comparison of multiple resources 
  and for the presentation of the results in a special compare editor. </P>
<P CLASS="Para"><b>Setup</b> </P>
<P CLASS="Para">Before commencing with compare a few files must be created. This 
  will also be a good time to recap some of the basic features that have already 
  been introduced.</P>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Start by selecting all of the projects in one of the navigation 
      views and deleting them by using <b>Delete</b> on the pop-up menu.</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Create a new simple project using <b>File &gt; New &gt; Project</b>. 
      Be sure to give the project a distinct name by typing unique name as the 
      name of the new project, for example &quot;JaneQUserCompare&quot;.</p></li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Use the project's pop-up menu to create a file called file1.txt.</p>
    <p CLASS="Para">In the editor for file1.txt type the following lines of text 
      and save the file:</p>
    <blockquote> 
      <p CLASS="Para"><i>This is line 1.<br>
        This is line 2.<br>
        This is line 3.<br>
        This is line 4.<br>
        This is line 5.</i></p>
    </blockquote>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">In one of the navigation views select file1.txt and use Ctrl+C 
      to copy the file.</p></li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Para">Use Ctrl+V (Paste) to create the copy. In the name conflict 
      dialog which appears, rename the file to file2.txt.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>(On the Mac, use &#8984;+C and &#8984;+V.)</p>
<P>There are now two identical files, file1.txt and file2.txt. </P>
