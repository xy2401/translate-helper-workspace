<h1 class="Head"> Synchronizing with a CVS repository</h1>
   
<p class="Para"> In the CVS team programming environment, there are    two
distinct processes involved in synchronizing resources: <i>updating</i> 
   with the latest changes from a branch and <i>committing</i> to the branch.&nbsp;</p>
   
<p class="Para">When you make changes in the Workbench, the resources   
are saved locally.&nbsp; Eventually you will want to commit your changes
to the branch so others can have access to them.&nbsp; Meanwhile, others
may have committed changes to the branch.&nbsp; You will want to update
your Workbench resources with their changes.</p>
   
<p class="Para"><b>Important!</b>: It is preferable to update <i> before</i>
    committing, in case there are conflicts with the resources in your Workbench
   and the resources currently in the branch.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
   
<p>The synchronize view contains filters to control whether you want to view only 
  <i>incoming changes</i> or <i>outgoing changes</i>. Incoming changes come from 
  the branch. If accepted, they will update the Workbench resource to the latest 
  version currently committed into the branch. Outgoing changes come from the 
  Workbench. If committed, they will change the branch resources to match those 
  currently present in the Workbench. </p>
     
<p>Regardless of which mode (filter) you select, the Synchronize view always 
shows    you conflicts that arise when you have locally modified a resource 
for which    a more recent version is available in the branch. In this 
situation you    can choose to do one of three things: update the resource 
from the branch, commit    your version of the resource to the branch, or 
merge your work with the changes    in the branch resource. Typically 
you will want to merge, as the other    two options will result in loss of 
work. </p>
