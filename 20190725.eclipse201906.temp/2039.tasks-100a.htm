<H1>Branching</H1>

<P>Creating a branch and releasing resources to that branch is useful in cases 
  where you are not yet ready to put your changes in the main development flow. 
  It is also useful for creating incremental patches to existing versions.
</P>

<P>To create a branch:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>From the context menu of the project, select <b>Team &gt; Branch</b>.
  <p><img src="../images/cvs_new_branch.png" alt="Create a new CVS Branch dialog" border="0">
  </p></li>
  <li>Enter the Branch Name for the new branch in the text area.</li>
  <li>A default version tag  name will be proposed by the dialog. If you do not like the suggested name, you can change
   it in the text area.</li>
  <li>If you would like to start working in the branch immediately, make sure 
    the checkbox is selected.</li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p><em>Note:</em> The Version Name is important; you will need this when you want 
  to merge your changes later on. It identifies the point at which the branch 
  was created.
</p>
