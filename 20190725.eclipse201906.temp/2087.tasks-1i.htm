<H1>Working with a CVS repository</H1>

<p>In the CVS team programming environment, team members do all of their work 
in their own Workbenches, isolated from others. Eventually they will want to 
share their work. They do this via a CVS repository. The Workbench provides 
a number of mechanisms which support working with CVS repositories. See the 
Related tasks links for more details. </p>
