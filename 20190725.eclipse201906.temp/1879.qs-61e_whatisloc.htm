<h1>Repository locations</h1>
<DIV CLASS="Subtopic">

  <p CLASS="Para">Now that a new repository location has been added to the CVS 
    Repositories view, the following will explain what a repository location is 
    or, more importantly, what it isn't.</p>
  <p CLASS="Para">A repository location is not an actual live connection. Instead, 
    it is a description of where the repository is located. At a later time, when 
    instructions are given explaining how to commit work to the repository or 
    update with work done by others, the Workbench will create a connection based 
    on this location information. Connections will be opened and closed as required 
    when performing CVS team operations, and those connections will be based on 
    the information provided in the repository location. </p>
  <p CLASS="Para">When disconnected from the network the CVS Repositories view 
    continues to display the list of known repository locations. In addition, 
    the projects themselves will still know the repository location they are associated 
    with.</p>
