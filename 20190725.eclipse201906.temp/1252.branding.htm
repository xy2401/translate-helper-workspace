<h1>Product Branding</h1>
<p>The <strong>Branding</strong> page gives the product its identity by customizing the window images, <em>About</em> dialog and the welcome experience. </p>

<h2>Window Images </h2>
<p>The <strong>Window Images</strong> section specifies the images associated with a product. If the images supplied by you do not match the size requirements, PDE flags a warning at the top of the page. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/branding_window.png" alt="Window Images" > </p>

<h2>About Dialog </h2>
<p>The <strong>About Dialog</strong> is customiable by providing a custom image and text. </p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/branding_about.png" alt="About Image" ></p>
<p>The <em>About dialog</em> text and image are also properties in the org.eclipse.core.runtime.products extension. </p>

<h2>Welcome Page </h2>
<p>It is recommended to ship a product with its own <strong>welcome page</strong> to introduce the features of the product to first-time users.</p>
<p><img src="../../../images/product_editor/branding_welcome.png" alt="Intro" ></p>
<p>Providing a <strong>welcome page</strong> (Intro) requires the binding of the product to an <em>org.eclipse.ui.intro</em> extension. </p>
<p>The Intro ID combo box is populated with existing Intro identifiers defined by plug-ins in the workspace and in the target.</p>
<p>You may also create a new Intro on the fly by pressing the New.. button. </p>
