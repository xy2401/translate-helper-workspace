<H1>Rearranging tabbed views</H1>
<p>In addition to dragging and dropping (docking) views inside the Workbench,
you can rearrange the order of views within a tabbed notebook.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Click on the tab of the view that you want to move and drag
    it to where you want it. A stack symbol
	<img border="0" src="../images/drop_stack.png" alt="drop stack image" >
	appears as you drag the view across other view tabs.</li>
  <li>Release the mouse button when you have the view tab in the
    desired location. The view that you selected is now moved.</li>
</ol>
