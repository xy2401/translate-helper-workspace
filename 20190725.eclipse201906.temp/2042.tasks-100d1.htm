<H1>Creating a global ignore pattern</H1>

<P>When synchronizing resources, often there are resources that you do not want 
  to commit to the repository. The Workbench provides a global pattern matching 
  facility for ignoring resources that can appear anywhere in your project hierarchy.
</P>

<ol>
  <li>Open the
    <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.preferences(preferencePageId=org.eclipse.team.ui.IgnorePreferences)")'>
    <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link">
    <b>Team &gt; Ignored Resources</b></a> preference page.
    This displays a list of resource 
    name patterns against which resources will be screened, before they are considered 
    as candidates for version control.</li>
  <li>Click the <b>Add Pattern...</b> push button and type the pattern that you want to match, 
    for example <samp>*.obj</samp>.</li>
  <li>Click <b>OK</b>.</li>
</ol>

<p>All files with an extension that matches the pattern that you added will be 
  excluded from version control.
</p>

<p>The patterns that you define may contain the wildcard characters * and ?. The 
  asterisk represents any sequence of zero or more characters, the question mark 
  represents a single character. For example, you can specify a pattern 
  of <samp>*~</samp>, which would match any temporary files that end with a tilde 
  (~). Any file or directory that matches any one of the patterns will be ignored 
  when files are being considered for version control. You can temporarily disable 
  ignoring the resource name pattern by deselecting it from the list. You do not 
  have to remove the specified pattern from the list.
</p>
  
<p>It is important to note that the path leading up to the resource name is not 
  included in the matching. For example, for the file &quot;/path/to/file.txt&quot;, 
  only the string &quot;file.txt&quot; is matched against the patterns.
  This facility is not intended for specifying fully-qualified path names but 
  for specifying globally applicable patterns.
