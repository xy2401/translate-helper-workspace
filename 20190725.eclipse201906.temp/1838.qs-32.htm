<h1>Deleting resources</h1>

<P CLASS="Para">Now that a few files have been imported into the second project 
  (JaneQUser2), here are instructions on how to delete the project.&nbsp;</P>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para">Select project JaneQUser2 in one of the navigation views.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> To delete the project do one of the following:</P>
    <ul>
      <li> From the project's pop-up menu choose <b>Delete</b> </li>
      <li>Press the DEL key </li>
      <li>Choose <b>Edit &gt; Delete</b> from the pull-down menu</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> A prompt will ask for confirmation of the deletion and also 
      what type of deletion should be performed.</P>
    <P CLASS="Para"> It is possible to:</P>
    <ul>
      <li> 
        <p CLASS="Para">Delete the contents of the project from the file system</p>
      </li>
      <li> 
        <p CLASS="Para">Delete the project from the workspace but keep its contents 
          in the file system</p>
      </li>
      <li>Accept the default (do not delete contents) and click <b>Yes</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Note:</strong> This is only an option for projects. Files and folders 
  are always deleted from the file system when deleted.</p>
<P> The same steps work for any resource shown in the navigation view. <br>
