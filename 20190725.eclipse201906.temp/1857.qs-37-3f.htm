Removing bookmarks</h1>
<p CLASS="Head">This section will demonstrate how to remove the bookmarks that 
  have been created.</p>
<ol>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para"> In the Bookmarks view, select JanesText.txt (the second bookmark 
      we created) and do one of the following:</P>
    <ul>
      <li> From the bookmark's context menu choose delete.</li>
      <li> Hit the Delete key on the keyboard.</li>
    </ul>
    <P CLASS="Para"> Notice that the bookmark is removed from the Bookmarks view.</P>
      <P CLASS="Para"> <img src="../images/Image54_bookmark_oneleft.png" alt="Bookmark view" border="0" ></P>
  </li>
  <li>There should be one remaining bookmark. This bookmark is associated with 
    a line in the file JanesFile.txt. There are two other approaches to removing 
    this bookmark. 
    <ul>
      <li>Use <b>Remove Bookmark</b> in the marker bar of the JanesFile.txt editor. 
        Remember, <b>Add Bookmark</b> was used in the marker bar when the 
        bookmark was first created.<br>
       <p>
        	<img src="../images/Image54_bookmark_remove2.png" alt="Bookmark menu" border="0" ></li>
       </P>
      <li>Delete the bookmark (as was done above) by using <b>Delete</b> from 
        the bookmark's popup menu in the Bookmarks view.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Here is the second approach.&nbsp;</p>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <P CLASS="Para">Ensure there is an editor open on JanesFile.txt.&nbsp;</P>
    <P CLASS="Para">Although the editor doesn't actually need to be open, the 
      editor update will be viewable as the bookmark is deleted.</P>
  </li>
  <li> 
    <p CLASS="Head">In the Bookmarks view, select JanesFile.txt (the remaining 
      bookmark). Press the Delete key. Notice that the bookmark is removed from the Bookmarks 
      view and the JanesFile.txt editor.&nbsp; </p>
  </li>
</ol>
