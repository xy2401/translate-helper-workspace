<H1 CLASS="Head">Merging from a branch</H1>

<P>After creating and working in a CVS branch for some time, you may want to merge 
  your changes from the branch into another branch, or into HEAD. To do this, 
  you will need to know:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>The name of the branch or version that contains your changes.</li>
  <li>The version from which the branch was created. This is the version name 
    that you supplied when branching.</li>
</ol>

<p>To merge your changes:
</p>

<ol>
  <li>Ensure that the destination is loaded into your workspace. For example, 
    if you wish to merge your changes into HEAD, make sure the project is shared 
    with HEAD in your workspace. To do this, select the project and choose <b>Replace 
    With &gt; Another Branch or Version</b> from the context menu. Then select 
    the branch to replace with.</li>
  <li>Select the project and choose <b>Team &gt; Merge</b>.</li>
  <li>Enter the branch or version which contains the changes you want to merge.</li>
  <li>The merge dialog will try to guess an appropriate start point. If that fails, 
    enter the start point of the merge. This is the version from which the branch 
    was created. Click <b>Finish</b>.</li>
  <li>A CVS Merge synchronization will be added to the Synchronize view, showing 
    all differences between your workspace and the branch with the changes.</li>
  <li>Load all of the desired changes into the workspace. This may be accomplished 
    by either manually merging changes, or by choosing <b>Update</b>, <b>Override 
    and Update</b>, or <b>Mark as Merged</b> from the tree's context menu.</li>
  <li>After all desired changes are in the workspace, choose <b>Team &gt; Synchronize 
    with Repository</b>. You may then commit all the changes to the repository.</li>
</ol>
<p><em>Tip</em>: If you don't know the start point of the merge, you can choose 
  to perform the merge directly into the workspace. This relies on the CVS server 
  to pick an appropriate start point. Because the merge is performed directly 
  into the workspace, CVS may introduce a text based conflict markup into the 
  file. This markup is typically hard to deal with so merging directly into the 
  workspace should only be done when necessary.</p>
<h3>Merge actions</h3>
<p>The actions in the merge editor complement the manual merge toolbar actions 
  that are available in the bottom half of the merge editor.</p>
<table width="100%" border="0">
  <tr> 
    <td width="20%"><strong>Merge</strong></td>
    <td width="80%">Running this action will bring the changes into the file in 
      the workspace. Any conflicts that are not auto-mergeable will be skipped.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><strong>Override and Update</strong></td>
    <td>This action is enabled on files with conflicting changes. Running this 
      action will discard any local changes you have and replace the file with 
      the remote contents.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td><strong>Mark as Merged</strong></td>
    <td>This action will remove the selected changes from the view. The changes 
      will only reappear if the remote state of the resource changes and the CVS 
      Merge Synchronization is refreshed.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
<p><em>Tip</em>: You can perform ongoing merges by pinning a CVS Merge Synchronization 
  in the Synchronize view. This will allow you to keep your workspace up-to-date 
  with the changes released to a different branch.</p>
