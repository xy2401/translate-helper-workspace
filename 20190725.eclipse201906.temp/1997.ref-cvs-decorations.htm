<H1 CLASS="Head">CVS Label Decorations</H1>
<P CLASS="Para"> Label Decorations are used by CVS to show important synchronization 
  information about workspace resources. Decorations can affect the text or the 
  icon of the label associated with a resource. The text decorators are configurable 
  on the <a href="../tasks/tasks-107b.htm">CVS Label Decorations Preference page</a> which can also be used to indicate 
  which icons are to be enabled. Here is a description of the icons used by CVS.</P>
<table width="94%" border="1">
  <tr>
    <td align="center"><strong>Decoration</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Resource type</strong></td>
    <td><strong>Description</strong></td>

    <td width="14%" align="center"><img src="../images/version_controlled.png" alt="Version control icon" ></td>
    <td width="22%">Any</td>
    <td width="64%">Indicates that the resource is under version control.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr> 
    <td align="center"><img src="../images/dirty_ov.png" alt="Outgoing icon" ></td>
    <td>Any</td>
    <td>Indicates that the resource or one of its children contains outgoing changes.</td>

      in the CVSROOT/modules file.</td>
