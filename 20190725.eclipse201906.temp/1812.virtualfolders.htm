<p>
Virtual folders are folders that exist only in the Eclipse workspace tree, and 
have no file system location.
</p>
<p>
By using virtual folders, file and folders can be organized in a project 
hierarchy independently of the file system location of those resources.
</p>
<p>
Regular file and folder resources can not be created under a virtual folder, since
they need a file system location as their parent in order to exist in the file system.  Only
other virtual folders, or linked resources can be created directly under a virtual folder.
