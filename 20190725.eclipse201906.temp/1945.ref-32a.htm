<h1 class="Head"> CVS History view</h1>
    
<p class="Intro"> This view provides a list of all the revisions of a resource in the repository as
well as all the revisions of a resource in the local history. From this view you can compare revisions,
load a revision, revert the corresponding workspace file to a revision, tag
with an existing tag, show annotations and open an editor on a revision. </p>
 
<p class="Para">Here is what the CVS History View looks like:</p>

<h2>Columns</h2>
<p class="Para">The History View is able to display both local and remote revisions. Local History revisions have
minimal information associated with them - only a time stamp. As a result, the majority of the column items will appear
blank for Local History revisions. Remote revisions, on the other hand, will have a much more complete set
of information. Here are the columns: </p>
