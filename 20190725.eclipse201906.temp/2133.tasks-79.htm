<P>You can filter the tasks or problems that are displayed in the Tasks or Problems

  can filter items according to which resource or group of resources they are 
  associated with, by text string within the Description field, by problem severity, 
  by task priority, or by task status. </P>

  <li>Select the radio buttons and checkboxes that correspond to
      your filtering objectives.</li>
