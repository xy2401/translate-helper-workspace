                  <div class="section">
                     <p>The fictional Global Computing Company was established in 1990. Global Computing distributes computer hardware and software components to customers on a worldwide basis. The Sales and Marketing department has not been meeting its budgeted numbers. As a result, this department has been challenged to develop a successful sales and marketing strategy.</p>
                     <p>Global Computing operates in an extremely competitive market. Competitors are numerous, customers are especially price-sensitive, and profit margins tend to be narrow. In order to grow profitably, Global Computing must increase sales of its most profitable products.</p>
                     <p>Various factors in Global Computing's current business point to a decline in sales and profits:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Traditionally, Global Computing experiences low third-quarter sales (July through September). However, recent sales in other quarters have also been lower than expected. The company has experienced bursts of growth but, for no apparent reason, has had lower first-quarter sales during the last two years as compared with prior years.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Global has been successful with its newest sales channel, the Internet. Although sales within this channel are growing, overall profits are declining.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Perhaps the most significant factor is that margins on personal computers - previously the source of most of Global Computing's profits - are declining rapidly.</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>Global Computing must understand how each of these factors is affecting its business.</p>
                     <p>Current reporting is done by the IT department, which produces certain standard reports on a monthly basis. Any ad hoc reports are handled on an as-needed basis and are subject to the time constraints of the limited IT staff. Complaints have been widespread within the Sales and Marketing department regarding the delayed response to report requests. Complaints have also been numerous in the IT department regarding analysts who change their minds frequently or ask for further information.</p>
                     <p>The Sales and Marketing department has been struggling with a lack of timely information about what it is selling, who is buying, and how they are buying. In a meeting with the CIO, the VP of Sales and Marketing states, "By the time I get the information, it is no longer useful. I am only able to get information at the end of each month, and it does not have the details I need to do my job."</p>

                        <p><a id="d31601e191" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>When asked to be more specific about what she needs, the Vice President of Sales and Marketing identifies the following requirements:
                        </p>
                        <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

                              <p>Trended sales data for specific customers, regions, and segments.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>The ability to provide information and some analysis capabilities to the field sales force. A web interface would be preferred, since the sales force is distributed throughout the world.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Detail regarding mail-order, phone, and email sales on a monthly and quarterly basis, and a comparison to past time periods. Information must identify when, how, and what is being sold by each channel.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Margin information on products to understand the dollar contribution for each sale.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>Knowledge of percent change versus the prior and year-ago period for sales, units, and margin.</p>
                           </li>
                           <li>
                              <p>The ability to perform analysis of the data by ad hoc groupings.</p>
                           </li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The CIO has discussed these requirements with his team and has concluded that a standard reporting solution against the production order entry system would not be flexible enough to provide the required analysis capabilities. The reporting requirements for business analysis are so diverse that the projected cost of development, along with the expected turnaround time for requests, would make this solution unacceptable.</p>
                        <p>The CIO's team recommends using an analytic workspace to support analysis. The team suggests that the Sales and Marketing department's IT group work with Corporate IT to build an analytic workspace that meets their needs for information analysis.</p>

                        <p>We can identify the hierarchies that organize the levels within each dimension. To identify hierarchies, we group the levels in the correct order of summarization and in a way that supports the identified types of analysis.</p>
                        <p>For the Channel and Product dimensions, Global Computing requires only one hierarchy for each dimension. For the Customer dimension, Global Computing requires two hierarchies. Analysis within the Customer dimension tends to be either by geographic area or market segment. Therefore, we organize levels into two hierarchies, Shipments and Segment. Analysis over time also requires two hierarchies, a Calendar hierarchy and a Fiscal hierarchy.</p>
