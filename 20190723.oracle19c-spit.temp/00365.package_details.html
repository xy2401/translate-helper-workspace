                  <p>Packaging tasks (a box at the upper right)—Includes two buttons at the upper right-hand corner of the box: Generate Upload File and Send to Oracle. Below the buttons are four sections of links, where each link represents a packaging task. The sections are arranged in two rows and two columns. In the top left section, whose heading is "Edit Contents," the links are: Add Problems, Exclude Problems, and View Package Manifest. In the top right section, whose heading is "Scrub User Data," the links are: Copy out Files to Edit Contents and Copy in Files to Replace Contents.
