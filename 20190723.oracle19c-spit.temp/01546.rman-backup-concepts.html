                  <p>Although the database depends on other types of files, such as network configuration files, password files, and the contents of the Oracle home, you cannot back up these files with RMAN. Likewise, some features of Oracle Database, such as external tables, may depend upon files other than the data files, control files, and redo log. RMAN cannot back up these files. Use general-purpose backup software such as Oracle Secure Backup to protect files that RMAN does not support.</p>
                  <p>When you execute the <code class="codeph">BACKUP</code> command in RMAN, the output is always either one or more backup sets or one or more image copies.

                     </p>
                     <p>A database is in a consistent state after being shut down with the <a href="../rcmrf/SHUTDOWN.html#RCMRF155" target="_blank"><code class="codeph">SHUTDOWN</code></a> <code class="codeph">NORMAL</code>, <code class="codeph">SHUTDOWN IMMEDIATE</code>, or <code class="codeph">SHUTDOWN TRANSACTIONAL</code> commands. A consistent shutdown guarantees that all redo has been applied to the data files. If you mount the database and make a backup at this point, then you can restore the database backup later and open it without performing media recovery. But you will, of course, lose all transactions that occurred after the backup was created.

               <div>
                  <p>You can create RMAN backups or user-managed backups.</p>
                  <p>When performing a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-F4A66D43-CA48-412E-98E8-B25CE1C7B065"><span class="xrefglossterm">user-managed backup</span></a> of an online tablespace or database, an operating system utility can back up a data file at the same time that the database writer (DBWR) is updating the file. It is possible for the utility to read a block in a half-updated state, so that the block that is copied to the backup media is updated in its first half, while the second half contains older data. This type of <a href="glossary.html#GUID-E55A74E5-8AD7-478F-A458-E4CB2E389009"><span class="xrefglossterm">logical corruption</span></a> is known as a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-9999D934-31A1-44D5-995F-EC5B92583B17"><span class="xrefglossterm">fractured block</span></a>, that is, a block that is not consistent with an SCN. If this backup must be restored and the block requires recovery, then recovery fails because the block is not usable.
                  </p>
                  <p>For third-party snapshot technologies, you must use one of the following techniques to eliminate the risk of creating fractured blocks:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Ensure that the snapshot technology complies with Oracle requirements for online backups</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Take the database or data files offline</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Place the database in backup mode before using a third-party snapshot backup</p>

                  </div>
                  <p>Unlike user-managed tools, RMAN does not require extra logging or backup mode because it knows the format of data blocks. RMAN is guaranteed not to back up fractured blocks. During an RMAN backup, a database server session reads each data block and checks whether it is fractured by comparing the block header and footer. If a block is fractured, then the session rereads the block. If the same fracture is found, then the block is considered permanently corrupt. Also, RMAN does not need to freeze the data file header checkpoint because it knows the order in which the blocks are read, which enables it to capture a known good checkpoint for the file. </p>

                     <p>RMAN can store backup data in a logical structure called a backup set, which is the smallest unit of an RMAN backup.</p>
                     <p>A backup set contains the data from one or more data files, archived redo logs, control files, or server parameter file. Backup sets, which are only created and accessed through RMAN, are the only form in which RMAN can write backups to media managers such as tape drives and tape libraries.</p>
                     <p>A backup set contains one or more binary files in an RMAN-specific format. Each of these files is known as a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-AED62318-D45A-49FA-B4B4-DAD98647FCF6"><span class="xrefglossterm">backup piece</span></a>. A backup set can contain multiple data files. For example, you can back up 10 data files into a single backup set consisting of a single backup piece. In this case, RMAN creates one backup piece as output. The backup set contains only this backup piece.
                     </p>
                     <p>If you specify the <code class="codeph">SECTION SIZE</code> parameter on the <code class="codeph">BACKUP</code> command, then RMAN produces a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-6D6DDA5E-F1EF-4273-8649-137F1FC89EB6"><span class="xrefglossterm">multisection backup</span></a>. This is a backup of a single large file, produced by multiple channels in parallel, each of which produces one backup piece.

                     <p>For non-multisection backups, RMAN only records backup sets in the repository that complete successfully. There is no such thing as a partial backup set. This differs from an unsuccessful multisection backup, where it is possible for RMAN metadata to contain a record for a partial backup set. In the latter case, you must use the <code class="codeph">DELETE</code> command to delete the partial backup set.

If a media failure or disaster occurs, then you can restore your backups and recover lost changes.You can back up all or part of your database with the BACKUP command from within the RMAN client.You can provide arguments to the BACKUP command to override the default backup options.The BACKUP command takes a DEVICE TYPE clause that specifies whether to back up to disk or tape device.RMAN can create backups on disk as image copies or as backup sets.RMAN provides a range of options to name the files generated by the BACKUP command. When backing up to disk, you can specify a format to spread the backup across several drives for improved performance. RMAN attaches a character string called a tag to every backup it creates, as a way of identifying the backup. You can either accept the default tag or specify your own with the TAG parameter of the BACKUP command.User-specified tags are a useful way to indicate the purpose or usage of different classes of backups or copies. Use the TAG parameter with the BACKUP command to specify tags for backup sets and image copies.When creating backup sets, you can use RMAN support for binary compression of backup sets by including the AS COMPRESSED BACKUPSET option to the BACKUP command.A multisection backup enables large data files to be divided into sections that can be backed up in parallel across multiple channels. This provides faster backup performance and better recovery times.While an image copy is being created, RMAN uses multiple channels to write files sections. However, the output of this operation is one copy for each data file.You can perform a whole database backup with the database mounted or open. You can back up one or more tablespaces with the BACKUP TABLESPACE command or one or more data files with the BACKUP DATAFILE command. You can back up the control file when the database is mounted or open. RMAN uses a snapshot control file to ensure a read-consistent version. A manual backup of the control file is different from a control file autobackup. RMAN makes a control file autobackup after the files specified in the BACKUP command are backed up. To make a manual backup, you can either specify INCLUDE CURRENT CONTROLFILE when backing up other files or specify BACKUP CURRENT CONTROLFILE. RMAN automatically backs up the current server parameter file in certain cases. The BACKUP SPFILE command backs up the parameter file explicitly. The server parameter file that is backed up is the one currently in use by the instance. You can only back up a database in NOARCHIVELOG mode when the database is closed and in a consistent state.Preplugin backups ensure that an RMAN backup is usable after a non-CDB is plugged in as a PDB into a CDB. Use the BACKUP command to back up multitenant container databases (CDBs) and pluggable databases (PDBs).RMAN and Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control provide full support for backup and recovery in a multitenant environment.Backing up a whole multitenant container database (CDB) is similar to backing up a non-CDB. When you back up a whole CDB, RMAN backs up the root, all the pluggable databases (PDBs), and the archived redo logs.You can use RMAN to make a backup of only the root. Because the root contains critical metadata for the whole CDB, Oracle recommends that you back up the root or back up the whole CDB at regular intervals.Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) can be used to back up the root.RMAN enables you to back up one or more PDBs in a CDB using the BACKUP command. Preplugin backups of a PDB can be used to perform restore and recover operations after the PDB is migrated and plugged in to a different destination CDB.Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) can be used to perform backups of pluggable databases (PDBs).Because tablespaces in different PDBs can have the same name, to eliminate ambiguity you must connect directly to a PDB to back up one or more of its tablespaces.This example creates a preplugin backup of the PDB my_pdb that is contained in CDB cdb_prod. The CDB uses shared undo and is open in read-write mode.RMAN enables you to use the BACKUP command to perform backup operations on the application root, one or more application PDBs, and the application container.RMAN can back up application containers, application PDBs, and the application root.Use the RMAN BACKUP command to back up the application root.Use the BACKUP command to back up an application container, which consists of the application root and all the application PDBs that belong to the application root.The BACKUP command is used to back up one or more application PDBs. Use the BACKUP command to back up sparse databases.RMAN enables you to back up a sparse database, using steps similar to backing up a whole database, in the backup set or image copy format.You can back up one or more tablespaces containing sparse data files or individual sparse data files using the BACKUP command. RMAN enables you to back up one or more sparse PDBs in a CDB. Archived redo logs are the key to successful media recovery. You should back them up regularly.Several features of RMAN backups are specific to archived redo logs. For example, you can use BACKUP ... DELETE to delete one or all copies of archived redo logs from disk after backing them up to backup sets. Even if your redo logs are being archived to multiple destinations and you use RMAN to back up archived redo logs, RMAN selects only one copy of the archived redo log file to include in the backup set. Because logs with the same log sequence number are identical, RMAN does not need to include more than one log copy.Automatic online redo log switching is an important RMAN feature. In a CDB, archived redo logs can be backed up only when you connect to the root as a common user with the SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP privilege. To back up archived logs, use the BACKUP ARCHIVELOG command.You can indicate that RMAN should automatically skip backups of archived redo logs.You can back up archived redo logs in a multitenant container database (CDB) by using the BACKUP ARCHIVELOG command.The BACKUP ARCHIVELOG ... DELETE INPUT command deletes archived log files after they are backed up. This command eliminates the separate step of manually deleting archived redo logs. In a CDB, you can delete archived redo logs after they are backed up by using the BACKUP ARCHIVELOG ... DELETE INPUT command.An incremental backup copies only data file blocks that have changed since a specified previous backup. Use the BACKUP command to create incremental backups.RMAN incremental backups provide multiple benefits.Choose a backup strategy according to an acceptable MTTR (mean time to recover). You can use the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) with the Oracle VSS writer to make a shadow copy or snapshot of files in a database.By incrementally updating backups, you can avoid the overhead of making full image copy backups of data files, while also minimizing time required for media recovery of your database. For example, if you run a daily backup script, then you never have more than 1 day of redo to apply for media recovery.To create incremental backups for use in an incrementally updated backup strategy, use the BACKUP ... FOR RECOVER OF COPY WITH TAG form of the BACKUP command. The command is best understood in a sample script that implements the strategy.The block change tracking feature for incremental backups improves backup performance by recording changed blocks for each data file.If block change tracking is enabled on a primary or standby database, then RMAN uses a block change tracking file to identify changed blocks for incremental backups. By reading this small bitmap file to determine which blocks changed, RMAN avoids having to scan every block in the data file that it is backing up.Oracle Database automatically manages space in the change tracking file to retain block change data that covers the eight most recent backups. After the maximum of eight bitmaps is reached, the oldest bitmap is overwritten by the bitmap that tracks the current changes.By default, the block change tracking file is created as an Oracle managed file in the destination specified by the DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST initialization parameter. You can also place the block change tracking file in any location that you choose, by specifying its name when enabling block change tracking. The size of the block change tracking file is proportional to the size of the database and the number of enabled threads of redo. You can enable block change tracking when the database is either open or mounted. When you disable block change tracking, the database removes the block change tracking file from the operating system.You can query the V$BLOCK_CHANGE_TRACKING view to determine whether change tracking is enabled, and if it is, the file name of the block change tracking file.To move the change tracking file, use the ALTER DATABASE RENAME FILE statement. You can use BACKUP... KEEP to create a backup that is both all-inclusive and exempt from the backup retention policy.You can exempt a backup from the retention policy by using the KEEP option with the BACKUP command. Typically, you make an archival backup to tape. Because your data protection backups are most likely to be on a set of tapes that remain accessible and are recycled, it is advisable to reserve a set of tapes for the archival backup. Use the BACKUP command with the KEEP option to make archival backups.One purpose of an archival backup is to create a test database. You can use the BACKUP BACKUPSET command to back up backup sets produced by other backup jobs. You can also use BACKUP RECOVERY AREA to back up recovery files created in the current and all previous fast recovery area destinations. The BACKUP BACKUPSET command creates additional copies of backup pieces in a backup set, but does not create a new backup set. For a backup retention policy based on redundancy, a backup set is counted as one instance of a backup. This statement is true even if there are multiple copies of the backup pieces that form the backup set, such as when a backup set has been backed up from disk to tape.Use the BACKUP BACKUPSET command to copy backup sets from disk to tape. Use the BACKUP command to back up image copies to tape.">Backing Up the Database</a></p>

For example, if a tape can hold 10 GB, but the backup set being created must hold 80 GB of data, then you must instruct RMAN to create backup pieces of 10 GB, small enough to fit on the tapes used with the media manager. In this case, the backup set media consists of eight tapes.

The database files on the disk subsystem can be managed by either Automatic Storage Management (ASM) or an alternative volume manager or file system. The considerations for backup tuning change depending on whether you manage database files with ASM.When a channel reads from or writes to disk, the I/O is either synchronous I/O or asynchronous I/O. On operating systems that do not support native asynchronous I/O, the database can simulate it with special I/O slave processes. These processes are dedicated to performing I/O on behalf of another process. You can use the RATE parameter to set an upper limit for bytes read so that RMAN does not consume excessive disk bandwidth and degrade online performance. Essentially, RATE serves as a backup throttle. In the copy phase, a channel copies blocks from the input buffers to the output buffers and performs additional processing.When backing up to SBT, RMAN gives the media management software a stream of bytes and associates a unique name with this stream. All details of how and where that stream is stored are handled entirely by the media manager. Thus, a backup to tape involves the interaction of both RMAN and the media manager.The RMAN-specific factors affecting the SBT write phase are analogous to the factors affecting disk reads. In both cases, the buffer allocation, slave processes, and synchronous or asynchronous I/O affect performance. Multiple factors affect the speed of the backup to tape.If the tape device is remote, then the media manager must transfer data over the network. The tape native transfer rate is the speed of writing to a tape without compression. This speed represents the upper limit of the backup rate. The level of tape compression is very important for backup performance. If the tape has good compression, then the sustained backup rate is faster. Tape streaming during write operations has a major effect on tape backup performance. The physical tape block size can affect backup performance. The principal factor affecting the write phase for disk is the buffer size. Typically, you begin the tuning process by using V$ views to determine where RMAN backup and restore operations are encountering problems.You can monitor the progress of backups and restore jobs by querying the view V$SESSION_LONGOPS. RMAN uses two types of rows in V$SESSION_LONGOPS: detail rows and aggregate rows.You can use the V$BACKUP_SYNC_IO and V$BACKUP_ASYNC_IO views to determine the source of backup or restore bottlenecks and to see detailed progress of backup jobs.Query the V$BACKUP_SYNC_IO view to identify bottlenecks with synchronoous I/O.Query the V$BACKUP_ASYNC_IO to identify bottlenecks with asynchronous I/O.Many factors can affect backup performance. Often, finding the solution to a slow backup is a process of trial and error. The RATE parameter on a channel is intended to reduce, rather than increase, backup throughput so that more disk bandwidth is available for other database operations. If the backup is not streaming to tape, then confirm that the RATE parameter is not set.Some operating systems support native asynchronous I/O. If and only if your disk does not support asynchronous I/O, then set DBWR_IO_SLAVES. Any nonzero value for DBWR_IO_SLAVES causes a fixed number of disk I/O slaves to be used for backup and restore, which simulates asynchronous I/O.Set the LARGE_POOL_SIZE initialization parameter if the database reports an error in the alert log stating that it does not have enough memory and that it cannot start I/O slaves.You can perform several tasks to identify and remedy bottlenecks that affect backup performance. One reliable way to determine whether the output device or input disk I/O is the bottleneck in a given backup job is to compare the time required to run backup tasks with the time required to run BACKUP VALIDATE of the same tasks. BACKUP VALIDATE of a backup performs the same disk reads as a real backup but performs no I/O to an output device.Tuning the read phase can help to improve RMAN performance.If the read phase is performing well, then the copy or write phases are probably the bottleneck. In particular, if RMAN is sending data blocks to the tape drive fast enough to support streaming, but the tape is not streaming, then the SBT write phase is the bottleneck.">Tuning RMAN Performance</a> to learn about RMAN buffer management

                     <p>RMAN multiplexing is determined by several factors. For example, the <code class="codeph">FILESPERSET</code> parameter of the <code class="codeph">BACKUP</code> command determines how many data files to put in each backup set. The <code class="codeph">MAXOPENFILES</code> parameter of <code class="codeph">ALLOCATE CHANNEL</code> or <code class="codeph">CONFIGURE CHANNEL</code> defines how many data files RMAN can read from simultaneously. The basic multiplexing algorithm is as follows:

                           <p>This is the number of input files simultaneously read and then written into the same backup piece. The level of multiplexing is the minimum of <code class="codeph">MAXOPENFILES</code> and the number of files in each backup set. The <code class="codeph">MAXOPENFILES</code> default is 8.

                     <p>Suppose that you back up 12 data files with one channel when <code class="codeph">FILEPERSET</code> is set to 4. The level of multiplexing is the lesser of this number and 8. Thus, the channel simultaneously writes blocks from 4 data files into each backup piece.

                  <div>
                     <p>During a proxy copy, RMAN turns over control of the data transfer to a media manager that supports this feature. Proxy copy can only be used with media managers that support it and cannot be used with channels of type <code class="codeph">DISK</code>. The <code class="codeph">PROXY</code> option of the <code class="codeph">BACKUP</code> command specifies that a backup is a proxy copy.

                     <p>For each file that you attempt to back up with the <code class="codeph">BACKUP</code> <code class="codeph">PROXY</code> command, RMAN queries the media manager to determine whether it can perform a proxy copy.

(Use the <code class="codeph">PROXY</code> <code class="codeph">ONLY</code> option to force RMAN to fail if a proxy copy cannot be performed.)

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>You can use the RMAN <code class="codeph">BACKUP</code> command to back up data blocks from sparse data files, tablespaces containing sparse data files, sparse pluggable databases (PDBs), and multitenant container databases (CDBs) containing sparse PDBs. 
                  </p>
                  <p>A sparse data file is a logical Oracle object that is created as a shadow of a base data file object and is stored in a physical storage space known as delta space. For instance, consider a sparse database <code class="codeph">DB0</code> that is created from a base database <code class="codeph">DB</code>. In a sparse environment, it is mandatory that the base objects must be read-only. Unlike the base database, sparse databases are read-write databases. In this case, <code class="codeph">DB</code>, a read-only database, consists of 5 data files. <code class="codeph">DB0</code> recreates the logical versions of each of these 5 base data files and assigns a separate delta storage space for each individual file. When the sparse database <code class="codeph">DB0</code> updates a data block in one of the sparse data files, only the updated block is logically stored in the delta space of that modified data file. When you choose to perform a sparse backup on <code class="codeph">DB0</code>, the operation will copy data only from the delta storage space of the database and the delta space of the sparse data files. A sparse backup can either be in the backup set format (default) or the image copy format. RMAN restores sparse data files from sparse backups and then recovers them from archive and redo logs. You can perform a complete or a point-in-time recovery on sparse data files.
                  </p>
                  <p>To perform sparse backup and recovery operations, your database must have the <code class="codeph">COMPATIBLE</code> initialization parameter set to 12.2 or higher.
                  </p>
                  <p>If your database has the <code class="codeph">COMPATIBLE</code> initialization parameter as 12.2 and you perform a full or level 0 incremental backup on a non-sparse (normal) data file, then RMAN performs a traditional full or level 0 incremental backup of the specified data file. On the other hand, if you perform a full or level 0 incremental backup on a sparse data file, then RMAN performs a backup only of all the latest changes from the delta storage space of that particular data file.
                  </p>
                  <p>For a database with the <code class="codeph">COMPATIBLE</code> initialization parameter less than 12.2, RMAN continues to perform the backup and recovery operations as before and are not influenced by the sparseness of a data file.
                  </p>
                  <p>Sparse backups help in efficiently managing storage space and facilitate faster backup and recovery.</p>

                  <p>A preplugin backup is an RMAN backup of a non-CDB or a PDB that was created before the non-CDB or PDB was plugged in to a different CDB.</p>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>The CDB into which the non-CDB or PDB is plugged in is referred to as the destination CDB. Preplugin backups can be used for PDB restore and recovery operations in destination CDB. To perform media recovery, all the required archive redo logs must be included in the preplugin backup.</p>
                  <p>For preplugin backups to be usable in the destination CDB, metadata about the preplugin backups must be exported to the RMAN repository of the destination CDB. When a PDB is unplugged from a source CDB, the required metadata is stored in the XML file created during the unplug operation. With non-CDBs, metadata required to make preplugin backups usable in the destination CDB is added to the non-CDB’s data dictionary using the <code class="codeph">DBMS_PDB.EXPORTRMANBACKUP()</code> procedure.
                  </p>
                  <p>Preplugin backups are usable only on the destination CDB into which the source non-CDB or PDB are plugged in. For example, assume that you migrate a PDB from the CDB <code class="codeph">src_cdb</code> to the CDB <code class="codeph">stage_cdb</code>. Subsequently, you migrate the source PDB from the CDB <code class="codeph">stage_cdb</code> to the CDB <code class="codeph">prod_cdb</code>. The PDB backups created on the CDB <code class="codeph">src_pdb</code> are accessible to CDB <code class="codeph">stage_pdb</code>. However, the CDB <code class="codeph">prod_cdb</code> can only access the PDB backups created on the CDB <code class="codeph">stage_cdb</code>, not the PDB backups created on the CDB <code class="codeph">src_cdb</code>.

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>Having recent backups of your control file and server parameter file is extremely valuable in many recovery situations. To ensure that you have backups of these files, the database supports control file and server parameter file autobackups. </p>
                  <p>The autobackup occurs independently of any backup of the current control file explicitly requested as part of your <code class="codeph">BACKUP</code> command. With a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-7CDA6567-DFB0-450D-8771-B033E9872AF7"><span class="xrefglossterm">control file autobackup</span></a>, RMAN can recover the database even if the current control file, recovery catalog, and server parameter file are inaccessible. Because the path used to store the autobackup follows a well-known format, RMAN can search for and restore the server parameter file from that autobackup. After you have started the instance with the restored server parameter file, RMAN can restore the control file from the autobackup. After you mount the control file, use the RMAN repository in the mounted control file to restore the data files.
                  </p>
                  <p>It is recommended that you turn on control file autobackups. Otherwise, RMAN database point-in-time recovery (DBPITR) and point-in-time recovery (PITR) for <a href="glossary.html#GUID-993BFB3F-3305-481C-999D-26132095DEC9"><span class="xrefglossterm">PDB</span></a>s may not work effectively when PITR needs to undo data file additions or deletions.

                  <p>An incremental backup copies only those data blocks that have changed since a previous backup. You can use RMAN to create incremental backups of data files, tablespaces, or the whole database.</p>
                  <p>By default, RMAN makes full backups. A <a href="glossary.html#GUID-D47BE9B3-BAE1-4415-B4B4-4D577B6CB493"><span class="xrefglossterm">full backup</span></a> of a data file includes every allocated block in the file being backed up. A full backup of a data file can be an image copy, in which case every data block is backed up. It can also be stored in a backup set, in which case data file blocks not in use may be skipped.
                  </p>
                  <p>A full backup has no effect on subsequent incremental backups. Image copies are always full backups because they include every data block in a data file. A backup set is by default a full backup because it can potentially include every data block in a data file, although <a href="glossary.html#GUID-0AA7EB43-FEA6-405F-9443-A4A2B43FFF96"><span class="xrefglossterm">unused block compression</span></a> means that blocks never used are excluded and, in some cases, currently unused blocks are excluded (see <span class="q">"<a href="rman-backup-concepts.html#GUID-073C85A4-E28C-4FE2-A089-1EABF3D00070" title="RMAN can use block compression when creating backup sets.">About RMAN Block Compression for Backup Sets</a>"</span>).
                  </p>

                  <div>
                     <p>The following concepts are essential for understanding the algorithm that RMAN uses to make incremental backups:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Checkpoint SCN</p>
                           <p>Every data file has a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-22212AAE-6F3C-4E84-B940-5AB2261A7EDA"><span class="xrefglossterm">data file checkpoint</span></a> SCN, which you can view in <code class="codeph">V$DATAFILE.CHECKPOINT_CHANGE#</code>. All changes with an SCN <span class="italic">lower</span> than this SCN are guaranteed to be in the file. When a level 0 incremental backup is restored, the restored data file contains the checkpoint SCN that it had when the level 0 was created. When a level 1 incremental backup is applied to a file, the checkpoint SCN of the file is advanced to the checkpoint SCN that the file had when the incremental level 1 backup was created.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Incremental start SCN</p>
                           <p>This SCN applies only to level 1 incremental backups. All blocks whose SCN is greater than or equal to the incremental start SCN are included in the backup. Blocks whose SCN is lower than the incremental start SCN are not included in the backup. The incremental start SCN is most often the checkpoint SCN of the parent of the level 1 backup.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Block SCN</p>
                           <p>Every data block in a data file records the SCN at which the most recent change was made to the block.</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>When RMAN makes a level 1 incremental backup of a file, RMAN reads the file, examines the SCN of every block, and backs up blocks whose SCN is greater than or equal to the incremental start SCN for this backup. If the backup is differential, then the incremental start SCN is the checkpoint SCN of the most recent level 1 backup. If the backup is cumulative, then the incremental start SCN is the checkpoint SCN of the most recent level 0 backup.</p>
                     <p>When block change tracking is enabled, RMAN uses bitmaps to avoid reading blocks that have not changed during the range from incremental start SCN to checkpoint SCN. RMAN still examines every block that is read and uses the SCN in the block to decide which blocks to include in the backup.</p>
                     <p>One consequence of the incremental backup algorithm is that RMAN applies all blocks containing changed data during recovery, even if the change is to an object created with the <code class="codeph">NOLOGGING</code> option. Thus, if you restore a backup made before <code class="codeph">NOLOGGING</code> changes were made, then incremental backups are the only way to recover these changes.

                  <div>
                     <p>During media recovery, RMAN examines the restored files to determine whether it can recover them with an incremental backup. If it has a choice, then RMAN always chooses incremental backups over archived redo logs because applying changes at a block level is faster than applying redo.</p>
                     <p>RMAN does not need to restore a base incremental backup of a data file to apply incremental backups to the data file during recovery. For example, you can restore data file image copies and recover them with incremental backups.</p>

                     <p>The incremental-forever backup strategy eliminates the need for creating recurring full backups when backing up to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance). Although Recovery Appliance supports other RMAN backup strategies, the recommended method for ongoing backups is the incremental-forever backup strategy.</p>
                     <p>With the incremental-forever backup strategy, you need to create only one initial level 0 full backup and subsequent level 1 incremental backups. The initial backup and the subsequent incrementals must be RMAN backup sets and not image copies.</p>
                     <p>Note that the Recovery Appliance incremental-forever backup strategy is different from the incrementally updated backup strategy in a conventional RMAN setup. With RMAN, incrementally updated backups use an initial image copy, followed by incremental backups which are eventually merged into the full backup. Therefore, there is always at least one full image copy, a few incremental backups, and some archived redo logs.</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>You can use the <code class="codeph">CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY</code> command to create a persistent and automatic backup retention policy. 
                  </p>
                  <p>When a backup retention policy is in effect, RMAN considers a backup of data files or control files as an <a href="glossary.html#GUID-A4D8B0BE-D3B9-4DD9-A7B3-BC0D88D25DC0"><span class="xrefglossterm">obsolete backup</span></a>, that is, no longer needed for recovery, according to criteria specified in the <code class="codeph">CONFIGURE</code> command. You can use the <a href="../rcmrf/REPORT.html#RCMRF147" target="_blank"><code class="codeph">REPORT OBSOLETE</code></a> command to view obsolete files and the <a href="../rcmrf/DELETE.html#RCMRF121" target="_blank"><code class="codeph">DELETE OBSOLETE</code></a> command to delete them.
                  </p>
                  <p>As you produce backups over time, older backups become obsolete as they are no longer needed to satisfy the retention policy. RMAN can identify the obsolete files for you, but it does not automatically delete them. You must use the <code class="codeph">DELETE</code> <code class="codeph">OBSOLETE</code> command to delete files that are no longer needed to satisfy the retention policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>If a fast recovery area is configured, then the database automatically deletes files that are either obsolete or backed up to tape when more recovery area space is needed for new files. The disk quota rules are distinct from the retention policy rules, but the database never deletes files in violation of the retention policy to satisfy the disk quota. Refer to <span class="q">"<a href="maintaining-rman-backups.html#GUID-3F11ECB5-1321-45F5-A557-BB1A5BAF011F" title="If the RMAN retention policy requires keeping a set of backups larger than the fast recovery area disk quota, or if the retention policy is set to NONE, then the fast recovery area can fill completely with no reclaimable space.">Responding to a Full Fast Recovery Area</a>"</span>.
                  </p>
                  <p>A backup is obsolete when <code class="codeph">REPORT</code> <code class="codeph">OBSOLETE</code> or <code class="codeph">DELETE</code> <code class="codeph">OBSOLETE</code> determines, based on the user-defined retention policy, that it is not needed for recovery. A backup is considered an <a href="glossary.html#GUID-A8547B27-5415-4AAA-B2B4-C0998EB62E47"><span class="xrefglossterm">expired backup</span></a> only when RMAN performs a crosscheck and cannot find the file. In short, <span class="italic">obsolete</span> means a file is not needed, whereas <span class="italic">expired</span> means it is not found.
                  </p>
                  <p>A backup retention policy applies only to full or level 0 data file and control file backups. For data file copies and proxy copies, if RMAN determines that the copy or proxy copy is not needed, then the copy or proxy copy can be deleted. For data file backup sets, RMAN cannot delete the backup set until all data file backups within the backup set are obsolete.</p>
                  <p>The retention policy is not responsible for deleting or rendering obsolete archived redo logs and incremental level 1 backups. Rather, these files become obsolete when no full backups exist that need them. Besides affecting full or level 0 data file and control file backups, the retention policy affects archived redo logs and level 1 incremental backups. First, RMAN decides which data file and control file backups are obsolete. Then, RMAN considers as obsolete all archived logs and incremental level 1 backups that are not needed to recover the oldest data file or control file backup that must be retained.</p>

                     <p class="notep1">Note:</p>
                     <p>RMAN cannot implement an automatic retention policy if backups are deleted by non-RMAN techniques, for example, through the media manager's tape retention policy.

                     <p>A recovery window is a period that begins with the current time and extends backward in time to the point of recoverability. The point of recoverability is the earliest time for a hypothetical point-in-time recovery, that is, the earliest point to which you can recover following a media failure.</p>
                     <p>For example, if you implement a recovery window of 1 week, then RMAN retains full backups and required incremental backups and archived logs so that the database can be recovered up to 7 days in the past. You implement this retention policy as follows:</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO RECOVERY WINDOW OF 7 DAYS;
</code></pre><p>This command ensures that for each data file, one backup that is older than the point of recoverability is retained. For example, if the recovery window is <code class="codeph">7</code>, then there must always exist one backup of each data file that satisfies the following condition:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>SYSDATE - BACKUP CHECKPOINT TIME &gt;= 7

                     <p>In this scenario, the current time is January 30 and the point of recoverability is January 23. Note how the January 15 backup is <span class="italic">not</span> obsolete even though a more recent backup (January 29) exists in the recovery window. This situation occurs because restoring the January 29 backup does not enable you to recover to the earliest time in the window, January 23. To ensure recoverability to any point in the window, you must save the January 15 backup and all archived logs from sequence 500 to 1150.

                     <p>In some cases using a recovery window can complicate disk space planning because the number of backups that must be retained is not constant and depends on the backup schedule. In contrast, a redundancy-based retention policy specifies how many backups of each data file must be retained. </p>
                     <p>For example, you can configure a redundancy of 2 as follows:</p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY TO REDUNDANCY 2;
</code></pre><p>The default retention policy is configured to <code class="codeph">REDUNDANCY</code> <code class="codeph">1</code>.

                     <p>You can run the <code class="codeph">REPORT OBSOLETE</code> command to determine which backups are currently obsolete according to the retention policy. 
                     </p>
                     <p>A companion command, <code class="codeph">DELETE OBSOLETE</code>, deletes all files that are obsolete according to the retention policy. You can run <code class="codeph">DELETE OBSOLETE</code> periodically to minimize space wasted by storing obsolete backups. For example, you can run <code class="codeph">DELETE OBSOLETE</code> in a weekly script.
                     </p>
                     <p>You can also override the configured retention policy by specifying the <code class="codeph">REDUNDANCY</code> or <code class="codeph">RECOVERY</code> <code class="codeph">WINDOW</code> options on the <code class="codeph">REPORT</code> or <code class="codeph">DELETE</code> commands. Using <code class="codeph">DELETE OBSOLETE</code> with a recovery window shorter than the configured recovery window effectively reduces the window of recoverability. For example, if the configured window is 14 days, but you execute <code class="codeph">DELETE OBSOLETE RECOVERY WINDOW OF 7 DAYS</code>, then you no longer have the ability to recover to a time between 7 and 14 days ago.

You can determine which data files need backups or which files were not backed up recently. Also, you can preview which backups RMAN must restore if a problem occurs.RMAN stores metadata of every database on which it performs operations.In a Data Guard environment, you can use the LIST, REPORT, and SHOW commands just as you can when not using Data Guard. You can run these commands with the FOR DB_UNIQUE_NAME clause to show the backups associated with a specified database. The LIST command uses the information in the RMAN repository to provide lists of backups and other objects relating to backup and recovery. The primary purpose of the LIST command is to list backup and copies. Specify the desired objects with the listObjList or recordSpec clause. If you do not specify an object, then RMAN displays copies of all database files and archived redo log files.You can specify several different conditions to narrow your LIST output.Use the LIST command to list preplugin backups and preplugin archived redo log files.Each time an OPEN RESETLOGS operation is performed on a database, this operation creates a new incarnation of the database.The RMAN REPORT command analyzes the available backups and your database. The REPORT command provides various reports of RMAN backups.Use the REPORT NEED BACKUP command to determine which database files need backup under a specific retention policy. You can use options of the REPORT NEED BACKUP command to specify different retention policies.The REPORT NEED BACKUP command can check the entire database, skip specified tablespaces, or check only specific tablespaces or data files against different retention policies.You can limit the backups tested by the REPORT NEED BACKUP command to disk-based or tape-based backups only.When a data file has been changed by an unrecoverable operation, such as a direct load insert, normal media recovery cannot be used to recover the file, because an unrecoverable operation does not generate redo. You must perform either a full or incremental backup of affected data files after such operations, to ensure that data blocks affected by the unrecoverable operation can be recovered using RMAN.You can report backup sets, backup pieces, and data file copies that are obsolete that is, not needed to meet a specified retention policy by specifying the OBSOLETE keyword. The REPORT SCHEMA command lists and displays information about the database files, tablespaces, and so on. You can view reports on the metadata related to a multitenant container database (CDB), the root only, or one or more pluggable databases (PDBs). Use the LIST command with the GUID option to list backups of pluggable databases (PDBs) that have been dropped from a multitenant container database (CDB).In some cases, V$ views supply information that is not available through use of the LIST and REPORT commands. An RMAN job is the set of commands executed within an RMAN session. Thus, one RMAN job can contain multiple commands. The ENCRYPTED column of the V$BACKUP_PIECE and V$RMAN_BACKUP_PIECE views indicates whether a backup piece is encrypted (YES) or unencrypted (NO).The LIST, REPORT, and SHOW commands provide the easiest means of accessing the data in the control file and the recovery catalog. RMAN obtains backup and recovery metadata from a target database control file and stores it in the tables of the recovery catalog. The recovery catalog views are derived from these tables. The recovery catalog views are not normalized or optimized for user queries.Most recovery catalog views contain the columns DB_KEY and DBINC_KEY. Each database registered in the recovery catalog can be uniquely identified by either the primary key, which is the DB_KEY column value, or the DBID, which is the 32-bit unique database identifier. Each incarnation of a database is uniquely identified by the DBINC_KEY column.Special considerations apply when querying the recovery catalog in a Data Guard environment. The DB_KEY value, which is the primary key for a registered database, is used only in the recovery catalog. The easiest way is to obtain the DB_KEY is to use the DBID of the target database, which is displayed whenever you connect RMAN to a database as TARGET. You can query the view RC_BACKUP_FILES for information about all backups of any database registered in the recovery catalog. Before querying RC_BACKUP_FILES, however, you must call the DBMS_RCVMAN.SETDATABASE procedure.">Reporting on RMAN Operations</a>to learn how to generate reports and delete backups

                  <div>
                     <p>If you configure a fast recovery area, then the database uses an internal algorithm to select files in the fast recovery area that are no longer needed to meet the configured retention policy. </p>
                     <p>The retention policy is never violated when determining which files to delete from the fast recovery area to satisfy the disk quota rules. These backups have status <code class="codeph">OBSOLETE</code> and are eligible for deletion to satisfy the <a href="glossary.html#GUID-925AC655-2953-4F1F-9E5A-F8EA6D9DA552"><span class="xrefglossterm">disk quota</span></a> rules.
                     </p>
                     <p>The RMAN status <code class="codeph">OBSOLETE</code> is always determined in reference to a retention policy. For example, if a database backup is considered <code class="codeph">OBSOLETE</code> in the RMAN repository, then it is because it is either not needed for recovery to a point within the recovery window, or it is redundant.
                     </p>
                     <p>There is one important difference between the fast recovery area rules for <code class="codeph">OBSOLETE</code> status and the disk quota rules for deletion eligibility. Assume that archived logs 1000 through 2000, which are on disk, are needed for the current recovery window and so are not obsolete. If you back up these logs to tape, then the retention policy considers the disk logs as required, that is, not obsolete. Nevertheless, the fast recovery area disk quota algorithm considers the logs on disk as eligible for deletion because they have been backed up to tape. The logs on disk do not have <code class="codeph">OBSOLETE</code> status in the repository, but they are eligible for deletion by the fast recovery area.
