An archival backup is exempted from the normal backup and recovery strategy. These backups are typically archived onto separate storage media and retained for long periods.RMAN backups can be used to transport databases and tablespaces across different platforms.Oracle provides multiple solutions for performing backup and recovery.You can use multiple techniques to create backups of the Oracle Database. This section compares the Recovery Manager (RMAN), user-managed backups, and Data Pump techniques.Oracle Flashback technology provides a set of features that complements your physical backup and recovery strategy. The logical-level flashback features of Oracle Database do not depend on RMAN and are available whether or not RMAN is part of your backup strategy.Flashback Database enables you to revert an Oracle Database to a previous point in time.The Data Recovery Advisor provides a single point of entry for Oracle backup and recovery solutions. It is a tool that automatically diagnoses persistent data failures, presents appropriate repair options, and executes repairs at your request. RMAN functionality can also be accessed using Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control. Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) is a browser-based management interface for Oracle Database. The Database Home page is the main database management page in Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control).You can perform a variety of both simple and advanced backup and recovery tasks with Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control).Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance) is a cloud-scale Engineered System that is designed to protect all the Oracle Databases in your enterprise. It achieves significant efficiencies in performance and manageability of backups by offloading most Oracle Database backup and restore processing to a centralized Recovery Appliance.You can use most RMAN commands to back up to and recover from Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance).The backup and recovery documentation roadmap is divided into two main paths: RMAN and user-managed backup and recovery. Optional paths are shown as splitting off and then rejoining each main path.This section provides a roadmap for navigating the backup and recovery documentation when using RMAN as your principal backup and recovery solution.This section provides a roadmap for navigating the backup and recovery documentation when you do not use RMAN as your principal backup and recovery solution.">	 Introduction to Backup and Recovery</a></p>

It greatly simplifies backing up, restoring, and recovering database files.Before you perform any operations using RMAN, you must connect to a target database.The RMAN backup and recovery environment is preconfigured for each target database. The configuration is persistent and applies to all subsequent operations on this target database, even if you exit and restart RMAN.Use the BACKUP command to back up files. RMAN backs up data to the configured default device for the type of backup requested. The BACKUP command includes a host of options, parameters, and clauses that control backup output.If a database runs in ARCHIVELOG mode, then you can back up the database while it is open.If a database runs in NOARCHIVELOG mode, then the only valid database backup is a consistent backup.Incremental backups capture block-level changes to a database made after a previous incremental backup.Incrementally updated backups enable you to implement an efficient incremental forever backup strategy.RMAN validation checks a backup to determine whether it can be restored. Validation also checks for corrupt blocks and missing files.RMAN supports the use of command files to manage recurring tasks such as weekly backups.RMAN can use the information stored in the RMAN repository to generate reports on backup activities.The LIST BACKUP and LIST COPY commands display information about backups and data file copies listed in the repository.The REPORT command performs more complex reporting analysis than the LIST command.RMAN repository metadata is always stored in the control file of the target database. The RMAN maintenance commands use this metadata when managing backups.Use the CROSSCHECK command to synchronize the logical records of RMAN backups and copies with the files on storage media.The DELETE command removes RMAN backups and copies from disk and tape, updates the status of the files to DELETED in the control file repository, and removes the records from the recovery catalog (if you use a catalog).Data Recovery Advisor is an Oracle Database tool that provides an infrastructure for diagnosing persistent data failures, presenting repair options to the user, and executes repairs at the user’s request.A failure is a persistent data corruption detected by the Health Monitor. Examples include physical and logical data block corruptions and missing data files.Use the RMAN REPAIR FAILURE command to repair failures that were detected.You can use the Oracle Flashback Database to rewind the whole database to a past time. Unlike media recovery, you do not need to restore data files to return the database to a past state.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands for RMAN restore and recovery of physical database files. To recover the database because a media failure damages database files, then first ensure that you have the necessary backups. Use the RESTORE DATABASE and RECOVER DATABASE commands to recover the whole database.Use the RESTORE TABLESPACE and RECOVER TABLESPACE commands on individual tablespaces when the database is open. In this case, you must take the tablespace that needs recovery offline, restore and then recover the tablespace, and bring the recovered tablespace online.RMAN can recover individual corrupted data file blocks."> Getting Started with RMAN</a></p>
