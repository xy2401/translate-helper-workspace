               <div>
                  <p>With Oracle Database, you can use services to manage the workload on your system by starting services on groups of servers that are dedicated to particular workloads.</p>
                  <p>At the database tier, for example, you could dedicate one group of servers to online transaction processing (OLTP), dedicate another group of servers to application testing, and dedicate a third group of servers for internal applications. The system administrator can allocate resources to specific workloads by manually changing the number of servers on which a database service is allowed to run. </p>
                  <p>Using groups of servers in this way isolates the workloads from each other to prevent demand surges, failures, and other problems in one workload from affecting the other workloads. However, in this type of deployment, you must separately provision the servers to each group to satisfy the peak demand of each workload because resources are not shared.</p>
                  <p>Oracle Database QoS Management performs the following actions:</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>

                     <p>When multiple database instances share a single server, they must share its CPU, memory, and I/O bandwidth.</p>
                     <p>Instance Caging limits the amount of CPU an Oracle database instance consumes by using the Oracle Database Resource Manager and the <code class="codeph">CPU_COUNT</code> database initialization parameter. When using Oracle Database QoS Management, the sum of the values for <code class="codeph">CPU_COUNT</code> for all instances of the server must be less than or equal to the total number of physical CPUs. Also, each CPU partition, or <span class="bold">slice</span>, must be uniform in thickness (number of CPUs) for each instance of a database within a server pool. These requirements help to ensure predictable and isolated performance of each database.

                     <!-- class="figure" -->
                     <p>When you implement instance caging, Oracle Database QoS Management can provide recommendations to reallocate CPU resources from one slice to another slice within the same server pool. If you choose to implement the recommendation to modify the instance caging settings, then Oracle Database QoS Management modifies the <code class="codeph">CPU_COUNT</code> parameter uniformly for all the database instances running on servers in the server pool.
                     </p>
                     <p>Modifying the <code class="codeph">CPU_COUNT</code> parameter and configuring Oracle Database QoS Management so that a Resource Plan is activated enables the Instance Caging feature. When you use Instance Caging to constrain CPU usage for an instance, that instance could become CPU-bound. This is when the Resource Manager begins to do its work, allocating CPU shares among the various database sessions according to the active resource plan.

                     <p>Oracle Database QoS Management uses database services to monitor and manage  client and application workloads.</p>
                     <p>In an Oracle RAC cluster, Oracle Database QoS Management monitors the server pools and nodes on which the database services are offered. A service can run in only one server pool. If the database spans multiple server pools, then you must create multiple services to access the instances in all server pools.</p>
                     <p>In the case of Administrator-Managed databases, all instances run in the Generic server pool and services run on specific instances, but still within a single pool.</p>
                     <p> Workload is monitored for clients and applications that connect to the database using database services that are managed by Oracle Clusterware. The connections must use Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) (thick or thin), or Oracle Call Interface (OCI). Connections should use services with its run-time goal for the load balancing advisory set to <code class="codeph">SERVICE_TIME</code>, and the connection load balancing goal set to <code class="codeph">LONG</code>. For example:
                     </p><pre class="pre codeblock"><code>srvctl modify service -db <span class="variable" translate="no">db_name</span> -service <span class="variable" translate="no">service_name</span> -rlbgoal SERVICE_TIME 
-clbgoal LONG -cardinality UNIFORM</code></pre><p>You must define the cardinality of database services as follows:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>If the server pool that the service runs in has a maximum size greater than 1 (or UNLIMITED), then set the cardinality of the service to <code class="codeph">UNIFORM</code>.
                           </p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>If the server pool that the service runs in has a maximum size of 1, then set the cardinality of the service to <code class="codeph">SINGLETON</code>.

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>A Policy Set enables you to specify your resources, Performance Classes (workloads), and one or more Performance Policies that specify the Performance Objective for each Performance Class.</p>
                  <p>The central concept in Oracle Database QoS Management is the <a href="glossary.html#GUID-2D3BCFE5-121C-4126-863C-053B6BECB7B9"><span class="xrefglossterm">Policy Set</span></a>. A Policy Set enables you to specify your resources, Performance Classes (workloads), and one or more Performance Policies that specify the Performance Objective for each Performance Class. A Policy Set can also specify constraints for resource availability. Oracle Database QoS Management Performance Policies manage the availability of resources system wide for each Performance Class so that the system is able to satisfy the Performance Objectives you set in the Performance Policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>When you use Oracle Enterprise Manager to create a new Default Policy for your system, Oracle Database QoS Management provides default classification rules and associated Performance Class names. For example, when you create the initial Policy Set, Oracle Database QoS Management discovers all database services in a cluster, and creates a Performance Class for each service. The Performance Class is named by appending <code class="codeph">_pc</code> to the service name. For example, if the name of a service is <code class="codeph">sales</code>, then the name assigned to the Performance Class for that service is <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code>.
                  </p>
                  <p>Only one Performance Policy in the Policy Set can be active at any time. You can activate Performance policies to respond to particular requirements by using calendar schedules, maintenance windows, events, and so on. </p>
                  <p>When you create a Policy Set, you specify which server pools in the cluster should be managed by Oracle Database QoS Management. You also define Performance Classes (used to categorize workloads with similar performance requirements). You then create a Performance Policy to specify which Performance Classes have the highest priority and the Performance Objectives of each Performance Class. To satisfy the Performance Objectives, Oracle Database QoS Management makes recommendations for reallocating resources when needed, and predicts what effect the recommended actions will have on the ability of each Performance Class to meet its Performance Objective. </p>
                  <p>For example, you could create a policy to manage your application workloads during business hours. The applications used by customers to buy products or services are of the highest priority to your business during this time. You also give high priority to order fulfillment and billing applications. Human resource and enterprise resource planning (ERP) applications are of a lower priority during this time. If your online sales applications experience a surge in demand, then Oracle Database QoS Management might recommend that more resources be allocated to the sales applications and taken away from applications of lesser importance. The recommendation also includes a prediction of the change in performance (positive or negative) for each Performance Class.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>With the introduction of server pools to logically divide a cluster, you can achieve the benefit of physical consolidation and resource agility while maintaining workload isolation.</p>
                  <p>When deciding how many clusters to create for your business, you need to compare the possible cost savings through consolidation of servers with the risk that the consolidated workloads will interfere with each other in some significant way. With the introduction of server pools to logically divide a cluster, you can achieve the benefit of physical consolidation and resource agility while maintaining workload isolation.</p>
                  <p>As the administrator, you can define the workloads that can run in various server pools, as shown in <a href="overview-oracle-database-qos-management.html#GUID-2C9A450E-5303-4F4B-9FCB-8D81D6A861C8__BABDAFHF">Figure 6-3</a>. Applications that connect to your Oracle RAC database use a service that runs only on the servers currently allocated to that server pool. For example, in <a href="overview-oracle-database-qos-management.html#GUID-2C9A450E-5303-4F4B-9FCB-8D81D6A861C8__BABDAFHF">Figure 6-3</a>, connections and applications that use the OS service access only the servers in the HR server pool, so that work done by those connections does not interfere with the applications using the Sales service. Oracle Database QoS Management can assist you with managing the resource allocations within each of those groups to meet your service levels, and can redistribute resources automatically to meet changes in your business requirements.

                  <!-- class="figure" -->
                  <p>With server pools, you can now create groups of servers that can be managed as a single entity. Databases can be created to run in these server pools. If each server runs only a single instance of a database, then if the database needs more resources, an additional server can be allocated to the server pool. If multiple database instances run on a single server, then they must compete for the shared resources of that server, such as memory and CPU. If one of the database instances is experiencing a much higher workload than the other instances, then that database instance can significantly degrade the performance of the other instances running on the same server. </p>
                  <p>You can use Instance Caging to limit the amount of CPU an Oracle Database instance consumes. By setting the <code class="codeph">CPU_COUNT</code> parameter to limit the maximum number of CPUs an instance can use, you partition the CPUs among the database instances on a server, thus preventing them from using excessive amounts of CPU resources. The <code class="codeph">CPU_COUNT</code> setting must be the same for each instance of a database within a server pool. Oracle Database QoS Management can monitor the CPU usage among all the database instances in the server pool, and recommend changes to the current settings if needed.
                  </p>

                  <!-- class="figure" -->
                  <p>Instead of using a single server pool, Oracle recommends that you manage services by creating multiple server pools, and relocate services between them. Using this configuration provides the following benefits:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Different types of workloads require different configurations, and have different tuning goals. For example, a customer using your OLTP applications to purchase goods or services expects the shipping and payment information screens to respond quickly. If your applications take too long to process the order, then the customer can lose interest, and your company might lose a sale. By contrast, an employee using an internal HR application is motivated to continue using HR screens, even if they do not respond quickly. If your HR applications take longer than expected to process an online task, the employee is unlikely to quit.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Applications can have various resource requirements throughout the day, week, or month to meet your business objectives. You can use server pools to divide the resources among the application workloads. To meet the Performance Objectives of a given time period, you could use server pool directive overrides in a Performance Policy to change the default attributes (such as Max or Min) for a server pool.</p>
                        <p>For example, if your company has an online tax filing application, then the application must prepare and file the tax statements for your customers before the government-specified deadline. In the timeframe immediately preceding a filing deadline, applications related to tax statement preparation and filing require more resources than they do at other times of the year. To ensure you meet this service requirement, you can create a Performance Policy named QuarterlyFilings to override the standard server pool directive, and specify that when QuarterlyFilings is active, the server pool used by the tax preparation applications should have a minimum of four servers instead of two to handle the additional workload. When the QuarterlyFilings Performance Policy is not in effect, your default Performance Policy is in effect, and the minimum number of servers in that server pool is two.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Because Oracle Database QoS Management regulates the number of servers that support a workload, application users experience a consistent level of performance, even in the presence of changing demand levels. This prevents performance expectations of your customers from being reset when workload levels change from low to high demand.</p>
                        <p>For example, assume your company sells a new consumer product that is in high demand, and your company advertises that they have large quantities of that product for sale at a reduced price. As a result, many new customers create orders for this product, and your OLTP applications must process a rapidly increasing number of transactions (a demand surge occurs). New customers do not know what to expect with regards to the OLTP application performance. However, existing customers can react negatively if their online shopping experience is impacted by the flood of new customers. Also, if your OLTP application cannot process all the incoming orders, then some of the new customers might quit the application and place their order with a different company, or visit a retail store instead.</p>
                        <p>Oracle Database QoS Management helps you to manage the reallocation of available resources to meet the demand surge without sacrificing the quality of service of your other applications.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Some workloads do not scale well but still benefit from the high availability of a cluster environment. Deploying these workloads in a fixed-size server pool offers both performance manageability and high availability.</p>
                        <p>For example, if you run an ERP application in a server pool with a fixed size of one server, then the maximum size of the server pool and the minimum size of the server pool are both set to one. If the server in that server pool fails, then Oracle Clusterware automatically allocates a new server to the server pool to maintain the minimum size of one server. Any instances and services located on the failed server are restarted on the new server, so the applications using these instances and services remains available.</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>You should create one or more server pools depending on the workloads that need to be managed. </p>
                  <p>When you first install Oracle Grid Infrastructure for a cluster, a default server pool (the <span class="bold">Free pool</span>) is created. All servers are initially placed in this server pool. When you create a new server pool, the servers that you assign to that server pool are automatically moved out of the Free pool and placed in the newly created server pool. At this point, you can install a database to run in that server pool, and create database services that are managed by Oracle Clusterware for applications to connect to that database. 
                  </p>
                  <p>For an Oracle RAC database to take advantage of the flexibility of server pools, the database must be created using the policy-managed deployment option, which places the database in one or more server pools. </p>
                  <p>In Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> release 1 (12.1.0.2), Oracle Database Quality of Service (QoS) Management supported administrator-managed Oracle RAC and Oracle RAC One Node databases in Measure-Only and Monitor modes. Starting with Oracle Database 12<span class="italic">c</span> release 2 (12.2.0.1), you can use Oracle Database QoS Management in Management mode with Oracle RAC and Oracle RAC One Node databases that are policy-managed or administrator-managed.

                     <p>When a work request arrives at a server, the work request is checked for a tag. If the work request has a tag, then the server concludes that this work request has already been classified, and the tag is not changed.

                     <p>To illustrate how work requests are classified, consider an application that connects to an Oracle RAC database. The application uses the database service <code class="codeph">sales</code>. The Oracle Database QoS Management administrator specified during the initial configuration of Oracle Database QoS Management that the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class should contain work requests that use the <code class="codeph">sales</code> service. When a connection request is received by the database, Oracle Database QoS Management checks for a tag. If a tag is not found, then Oracle Database QoS Management compares the information in the connection request with the classifiers specified for each Performance Class, in the order specified in the Performance Policy. If the connection request being classified is using the <code class="codeph">sales</code> service, then when the classifiers in the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class are compared to the connection request information, a match is found, and the database work request is assigned a tag for the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class.

                     <p>A single application can support work requests of many types, with a range of performance characteristics.</p>
                     <p>By extending and refining the default classification rules, the Oracle Database QoS Management administrator can write multiple Performance Objectives for a single application. For example, the administrator may decide that a web-based application should have separate Performance Objectives for work requests related to logging in, browsing, searching, and purchasing.</p>
                     <p>Oracle Database QoS Management supports user-defined combinations of connection parameters to map Performance Classes to the actual workloads running in the database. These connection parameters belong to two general classes, and can be combined to create fine-grained Boolean expressions:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

Each classifier in a Performance Class must specify the name of a database service. Additional granularity can be achieved by identifying the name of the user that is making the database connection from either a client or the middle tier. The advantage of using these classifiers is that they do not require application code changes to associate different workloads with separate Performance Classes.

                        </li>

These are optional parameters. The values for <code class="codeph">MODULE</code> and <code class="codeph">ACTION</code> must be set within the application. Depending on the type of application, you can set these parameters as follows:

                     <p>The <code class="codeph">PROGRAM</code> parameter is set or derived differently for each database driver and platform. Consult the appropriate Oracle Database developer's guide for further details and examples.
                     </p>
                     <p>To manage the workload for an application, the application code makes database connections using a particular service. To provide more precise control over the workload generated by various parts of the application, you can create additional Performance Classes, and use classifiers that include <code class="codeph">PROGRAM</code>, <code class="codeph">MODULE</code>, or <code class="codeph">ACTION</code> in addition to the service or user name. For example, you could specify that all connections to your cluster that use the <code class="codeph">sales</code> service belong to the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class, but connections that use the <code class="codeph">sales</code> service and have a user name of <code class="codeph">APPADMIN</code> belong to <code class="codeph">sales_admin</code> Performance Class.

                     <p>The Performance Classes in use at a particular data center are expected to change over time. For example, you might need to modify the Performance Objectives for one part of your application. In this case you would create a new Performance Class with additional classifiers to identify the target work requests, and update your Performance Policy to add a new Performance Objective for this Performance Class. In other words, you replace a single Performance Objective with one or more finer-grained Performance Objectives, and divide the work requests for one Performance Class into multiple Performance Classes. </p>
                     <p>Application developers can suggest which Performance Classes to use. Specifically, an application developer can suggest ways to identify different application workloads, and you can use these suggestions to create classifiers for Performance Classes so that each type of work request is managed separately. </p>
                     <p>You can create additional Performance Classes to specify acceptable response times for different application workloads. For example, a Performance Objective might indicate that a work request performing the <code class="codeph">checkout</code> action for the <code class="codeph">sales_pc_checkout</code> Performance Class should not take more than one millisecond to complete, and a work request performing the <code class="codeph">browse</code> action for the <code class="codeph">sales_pc_browse</code> Performance Class can take 100 milliseconds second to complete.

For example, you could define a Performance Policy for normal business hours, another for weekday nonbusiness hours, one for weekend operations, and another to be used during processing for the quarter-end financial closing. At any given time, a single Performance Policy is in effect as specified by the Oracle Database QoS Management administrator. Within each Performance Policy, the criticalness, or ranking, of the Performance Objectives can be different, enabling you to give more priority to certain workloads during specific time periods.

                     </p>
                     <p>Performance Objectives are specified with Performance Policies.

                     <p>A server pool directive override sets the availability properties of Min, Max, and Importance for a server pool when the Performance Policy is in effect. </p>
                     <p>A Performance Policy can include a set of <a href="glossary.html#GUID-3413500E-0636-4512-A864-E55D564FA9A7"><span class="xrefglossterm">server pool directive overrides</span></a>. Server pool directive overrides serve as constraints on the allocation changes that Oracle Database QoS Management recommends, because the server pool directive overrides are honored during the activation period of the Performance Policy. For example, Oracle Database QoS Management never recommends moving a server out of a server pool if doing so results in the server pool having less than its specified minimum number of servers.
                     </p>
                     <p>You could create Performance Policies for your system to manage workload based on the time of year or time of day, as shown in <a href="overview-oracle-database-qos-management.html#GUID-E6B0421C-B374-47AB-BCC2-76677C5DAB86__CHDBHIII">Figure 6-5</a>. Under normal conditions, these Performance Policies keep your database workload running at a steady rate. If the workload requests for a database increase suddenly, then a particular server pool might require additional resources beyond what is specified by the Performance Policy.

                     <p>For example, assume your business takes orders over the telephone, and creates orders using a sales application. Your telephone sales department is only open during regular business hours, but customers can also place orders themselves over the Internet. During the day, more orders are placed so the sales applications need more resources to handle the workload. This configuration is managed by creating the Business Hours Performance Policy, and specifying that the Back Office server pool can have a maximum of two servers, enabling Oracle Database QoS Management to move servers to the Online server pool, as needed. After the telephone sales department closes, the workload for the sales applications decreases. To manage this configuration you create the After Hours Performance Policy and specify that the Back Office server pool can have a maximum of four servers, enabling your internal applications to acquire the additional resources that they need to complete their workloads before the next business day.</p>
                     <p>In this scenario, the Business Hours and After Hours Performance Policies can contain server pool directive overrides. When a Performance Policy contains a server pool directive override, the current settings of Max, Min, and Importance for the specified server pool are overridden while that Performance Policy is in effect. This enables additional servers to be placed in the Sales server pool to give the online sales applications the resources they need and to limit the resources used by the Back Office server pool, so that its workload does not interfere with the Sales workload.</p>

                     <p>Within a Performance Policy, you can assign a level of business criticalness (a <span class="italic">rank</span>) to each Performance Class to give priority to meeting the Performance Objectives for a more critical Performance Class over a less critical one. When there are not enough resources available to meet all the Performance Objectives for all Performance Classes at the same time, the Performance Objectives for the more critical Performance Classes must be met at the expense of the less critical Performance Objectives. The Performance Policy specifies the <span class="italic">business criticalness</span> of each Performance Class, which can be Highest, High, Medium, Low, or Lowest.

                     <p>For example, using the Performance Policies illustrated in <a href="overview-oracle-database-qos-management.html#GUID-E6B0421C-B374-47AB-BCC2-76677C5DAB86__CHDBHIII">Figure 6-5</a>, when the Business Hours Performance Policy is in effect, the sales applications, which access the Online server pool, have the highest rank. If there are not enough resources available to meet the Performance Objectives of all the Performance Classes, then the applications that use the Online server pool will get priority access to any available resources, even if the applications using the Back Office server pool are not meeting their Performance Objectives.
                     </p>
                     <p>You can have multiple Performance Classes at the same rank. If Oracle Database QoS Management detects more than one Performance Class not meeting its Performance Objective and the Performance Classes are assigned the same rank in the active Performance Policy, then Oracle Database QoS Management recommends a change to give the Performance Class closest to meeting its Performance Objective more resources. After implementing the recommended action, when the Performance Class is no longer below its target performance level, Oracle Database QoS Management performs a new evaluation of the system performance.</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>The Oracle Database QoS Management Server retrieves metrics data from Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) and Oracle RAC One Node databases in the cluster.</p>
                  <p>The data are correlated by Performance Class every five seconds. The data include many metrics such as database request arrival rate, CPU use, CPU wait time, I/O use, I/O wait time, Global Cache use and Global Cache wait times. Information about the current topology of the cluster and the health of the servers is added to the data. The Policy and Performance Management engine of Oracle Database QoS Management (illustrated in <a href="overview-oracle-database-qos-management.html#GUID-E5CC78F2-6704-4358-B9A5-64483FF57F0C__BABGICBA">Figure 6-6</a>) analyzes the data to determine the overall performance profile of the system for the current Performance Objectives established by the active Performance Policy.
                  </p>
                  <p>The performance evaluation occurs once a minute, and results in a recommendation if any Performance Class does not meet its objectives. The recommendation specifies which resource is the <a href="glossary.html#GUID-440F0A8F-5CCB-4A14-B67E-39A20954F6F7"><span class="xrefglossterm">bottleneck</span></a>. Specific corrective actions are included in the recommendation, if possible. The recommendation also includes a listing of the projected impact on all Performance Classes in the system if you decide to implement the recommended action. 
                  </p>

                  <p>Oracle Database QoS Management enables you to manage excess capacity to meet specific performance goals through its recommendations.</p>
                  <p>If your business experiences periodic demand surges or must support an <a href="glossary.html#GUID-C3654AAB-1F8F-4870-9EE7-7C42C4423565"><span class="xrefglossterm">open workload</span></a>, then to retain performance levels for your applications you can design your system to satisfy the peak workload. Creating a system capable of handling the peak workload typically means acquiring additional hardware to be available when needed and sit idle when not needed. Instead of having servers remain idle except when a demand surge occurs, you could decide to use those servers to run other application workloads. However, if the servers are busy running other applications when a demand surge hits, then your system might not be able to satisfy the peak workload and your main business applications do not perform as expected.

                     <p>If a performance objective is not being met, then Oracle Database QoS Management evaluates several possible solutions and presents the most effective solutions as Recommendations.</p>
                     <p>When you use Oracle Database QoS Management, your system is continuously monitored in an iterative process to see if the Performance Objectives in the active Performance Policy are being met. Performance data are sent to Oracle Enterprise Manager for display in the Oracle Database QoS Management Dashboard (the Dashboard) and Performance History pages.</p>
                     <p>When one or more Performance Objectives are not being met, after evaluating the performance of your system, Oracle Database QoS Management seeks to improve the performance of a single Performance Objective: usually the highest ranked Performance Objective that is currently not being satisfied. If all Performance Objectives are satisfied with capacity to spare for both the current and projected workload, then Oracle Database QoS Management signals "No action required: all Performance Objectives are being met."</p>

                        <p>Another recommended action that Oracle Database QoS Management can display is to move a server from one server pool to another to provide additional resources to meet the Performance Objectives for a Performance Class.</p>
                        <p> If all the server pools in the cluster are at their specified minimum size, or if the server pool needing the resource is at its maximum size, then Oracle Database QoS Management can no longer recommend removing servers from server pools. In this situation the Dashboard displays "No recommended action at this time."</p>
                        <div class="infoboxnote" id="GUID-38083EC8-119E-4233-87DF-84496B008F2B__GUID-A0537C91-0B64-498A-BB28-536B291650A3">

                        </div>
                        <p>The minimum size of a server pool is the number of servers that that server pool is required to have. If you add the values for the server pool minimum attribute for each server pool in your cluster, then the difference between this sum and the total number of servers in the cluster represents shared servers that can move between server pools (or <span class="italic">float</span>) to meet changes in demand. For example, if your cluster has 10 servers and two server pools, and each server pool has a minimum size of four, then your system has two servers that can be moved between server pools. These servers can be moved if the target server pool has not reached its maximum size. Oracle Database QoS Management always honors the Min and Max size constraints set in a policy when making Move Server recommendations.
                        </p>
                        <p>If you set the minimum size of a server pool to zero and your system experiences a demand surge, then Oracle Database QoS Management can recommend moving all the servers out of that server pool so that the server pool is at its minimum size. This results in the Performance Classes that use that server pool being completely starved of resources, and essentially being shut down. A server pool with a minimum size of zero should only host applications that are of low business criticalness and Performance Classes that are assigned a low rank in the Performance Policy.</p>

                  <div>
                     <p>Oracle Database Quality of Service Management can offer multiple recommendations for improving workload performance.</p>
                     <p>When trying to relieve a resource bottleneck for a particular Performance Class, Oracle Database QoS Management recommends adding more of the resource (such as CPU time) for that Performance Class or making the resource available more quickly to work requests in the Performance Class. The recommendations take the form of promoting the target Performance Class to a higher Consumer Group, demoting competing Performance Classes within the resource plan, adjusting CPU resources shared between different slices in a server pool, or moving servers between server pools.</p>
                     <p>Implementing a recommended action makes the resource less available to other Performance Classes. When generating recommendations, Oracle Database QoS Management evaluates the impact to system performance as a whole. If a possible recommendation for changing the allocation of resources provides a small improvement in the response time of one Performance Class, but results in a large decrease in the response time of another Performance Class, then Oracle Database QoS Management reports that the performance gain is too small, and the change is not recommended. </p>
                     <p>Oracle Database QoS Management can issue recommendations that involve a negative impact to the performance of a Performance Class if:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>The negative impact on the Performance Class from which the resource is taken is projected not to cause a Performance Objective violation and a positive impact is projected for the Performance Class that gets better access to resources</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>The Performance Class from which the resource is taken is lower ranked, and thus less critical to your business, than the Performance Class being helped</p>
                        </li>
                     </ul>
                     <p>If the resource bottleneck can be resolved in multiple ways, then Oracle Database QoS Management recommends an action that is projected to improve the performance of the highest ranked Performance Class that is violating its objective. You can also view the alternative recommendations generated by Oracle Database QoS Management and see whether the action was recommended for implementation. For example, one possible solution to resolving a bottleneck on the CPU resource is to demote the Consumer Group associated with the Performance Class that is using the CPU the most. By limiting access to the CPU for the work requests in this Performance Class, the work requests in the other Performances Classes for that database get a larger share of the CPU time. However, Oracle Database QoS Management might decide not to recommend this action because the gain in response time for the target Performance Class is too small.</p>

                  </h4>
                  <div>
                     <p>Consider a system that has two servers in an Online server pool, and two servers in a Back Office server pool. The Online server pool hosts two workloads: the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class and the <code class="codeph">sales_cart</code> Performance Class. The minimum size of the Online server pool is two. The Back Office server pool hosts two internal applications: a human resources (HR) application and an enterprise resource planning (ERP) application. The Back Office server pool has a minimum size of one. The <code class="codeph">sales_cart</code> Performance Class has the highest rank and the <code class="codeph">erp_pc</code> Performance Class has the lowest rank. The <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class is ranked higher than the <code class="codeph">hr_pc</code> Performance Class.
                     </p>
                     <p>In this scenario, if the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> workload surges, causing contention for resources and causing the <code class="codeph">sales_cart</code> Performance Class to violate its Performance Objective, then this could lead to a service-level agreement (SLA) violation for the OLTP application. Oracle Database QoS Management issues a recommendation to increase access to the CPU for the <code class="codeph">sales_cart</code> Performance Class at the expense of the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> workload, because the <code class="codeph">sales_cart</code> Performance Class is of a higher rank; a higher rank indicates that satisfying the Performance Objective for the <code class="codeph">sales_cart</code> Performance Class is more important than satisfying the Performance Objective for the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class.
                     </p>
                     <p>If, after you implement the recommendation, the sales_cart and <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Classes are still not satisfying their Performance Objectives, then Oracle Database QoS Management issues a recommendation to increase the number of servers in the Online server pool by moving a server from the Back Office server pool, or a server pool that hosts less critical workloads or workloads with more headroom. In this scenario, a server can be moved from the Back Office server pool, because the Back Office server pool is currently above its minimum size of one. If the Back Office server pool had a minimum size of two, then Oracle Database QoS Management would have to find an available server in a different server pool; Oracle Database QoS Management does not recommend to move a server from a server pool if doing so will cause a server pool to drop below its minimum size.
                     </p>
                     <p>If you implement the recommended action, and your applications use Cluster Managed Services and Client Run-time Load Balancing, then the application users should not see a service disruption due to this reallocation. The services are shut down transactionally on the server being moved. After the server has been added to the stressed server pool, all database instances and their offered services are started on the reallocated server. At this point, sessions start to gradually switch to using the new server in the server pool, relieving the bottleneck.</p>
                     <p>Using the same scenario, if the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class and <code class="codeph">hr_pc</code> Performance Class both require additional servers to meet their Performance Objectives, then Oracle Database QoS Management first issues recommendations to improve the performance of the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class, because the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class is ranked higher than the <code class="codeph">hr_pc</code> Performance Class. When the <code class="codeph">sales_pc</code> Performance Class is satisfying its Performance Objectives, then Oracle Database QoS Management makes recommendations to improve the performance of the <code class="codeph">hr_pc</code> Performance Class.
