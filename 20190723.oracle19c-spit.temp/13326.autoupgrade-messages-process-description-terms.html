                  <p>An AutoUpgrade <strong class="term">Job</strong> is a unit of work associated with an upgrade, which is identified by a job identifier (<code class="codeph">jobid</code>). 
                  </p>
                  <p>A job represents a set of actions that AutoUpgrade performs. Each job goes through a set of stages to accomplish its purpose. The job is identified by a unique positive integer number, which is called a <code class="codeph">jobid</code>. Each new AutoUpgrade job produces a new job ID (<code class="codeph">jobid</code>) for each database found in the configuration file for the AutoUpgrade utility. If AutoUpgrade detects that a database with a <code class="codeph">jobid</code> that you previously started exists on your system is incomplete, then AutoUpgrade identifies this existing <code class="codeph">jobid</code> as a <strong class="term">resume</strong> operation. In a resume operation, stages of a job identified by a <code class="codeph">jobid</code> that did not complete during the previous AutoUpgrade run are continued from the point where they were stopped.

                  </p>
                  <p>The actions that occur during a stage are defined by the <strong class="term">processing mode</strong> that you select for AutoUpgrade: <strong class="term">Analyze</strong>, <strong class="term">Fixups</strong>, <strong class="term">Deploy</strong>, and <strong class="term">Upgrade</strong>. 
                  </p>
                  <p>AutoUpgrade has the following stages:</p>

                     </li>
                     <li><span class="bold">PREUPGRADE</span>: The stage in which AutoUpgrade performs checks of your system, based on your current system configuration to determine its readiness for upgrade, such as checking to determine if you have sufficient available disk space. 
                     </li>
                     <li><span class="bold">PRECHECKS</span>: The stage in which AutoUpgrade analyzes your source Oracle Database to determine if the database meets the requirements for upgrade.

                     <li><span class="bold">PREFIXUPS</span>: The stage in which AutoUpgrade performs preupgrade fixups before starting the upgrade. For example, this is the stage in which AutoUpgrade gathers dictionary statistics on the Source Oracle Database.

                     <li><span class="bold">DRAIN</span>: The stage during which AutoUpgrade drains database sessions from the Source Oracle Database instance, in preparation for shutting down the listeners and the database.

                     <li><span class="bold">POSTCHECKS</span>: The stage in which AutoUpgrade performs checks on the Target Oracle Database (the upgraded Oracle Database) before starting postupgrade fixups.
