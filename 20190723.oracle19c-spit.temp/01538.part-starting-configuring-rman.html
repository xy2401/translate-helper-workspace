During a backup or restore operation, the channel reads data from the input device, processes it, and writes it to the output device.The RMAN-supported device types are DISK and SBT (system backup to tape). RMAN can use automatic channels or manual channels for backup and recover operations.The RMAN repository is a collection of metadata about the target databases that RMAN uses for backup, recovery, and maintenance.The Oracle Media Management Layer (MML) API lets third-party vendors build media management software that works with RMAN to allow backups to sequential media devices such as tape drives.Before performing backup or restore to a media manager, you must allocate one or more channels to handle the communication with the media manager. You can also configure default channels for the media manager. The default channels are used for all backup and recovery tasks that employ the media manager and for which you have not explicitly allocated channels.Oracle Secure Backup is a media manager that provides reliable and secure data protection through file system backup to tape. All major tape drives and tape libraries in SAN, Gigabit Ethernet, and SCSI environments are supported.The Oracle Backup Solutions Program (BSP), part of the Oracle PartnerNetwork, is a group of media manager vendors whose products are compliant with Oracle's MML specification. Several products may be available for your platform from media management vendors. The fast recovery area is an optional disk location that can be used to store recovery-related files.Data Guard maintains standby databases as transactionally consistent copies of production database. A standby database can be either a physical standby database or a logical standby database.To simplify ongoing use of RMAN for backup and recovery, you can set some persistent configuration settings for each primary and physical standby database in a Data Guard environment. These settings control many aspects of RMAN behavior. For example, you can configure the backup retention policy, default destinations for backups to tape or disk, or default backup device type.RMAN uses a recovery catalog to track file names for all database files in a Data Guard environment. RMAN commands use the recovery catalog metadata to function transparently across different physical databases in the Data Guard environment. For example, you can back up a tablespace on a physical standby database and restore and recover it on the primary database. Similarly, you can back up a tablespace on a primary database and restore and recover it on a physical standby database.The recovery catalog tracks the files in the Data Guard environment by associating every database file or backup file with a DB_UNIQUE_NAME. The database that creates a file is associated with the file.The accessibility of a backup is different from its association. In a Data Guard environment, the recovery catalog considers disk backups as accessible only to the database with which they are associated, whereas tape backups created on one database are accessible to all databases.Recovery Appliance provides a centralized remote repository for backups of all target databases in the enterprise. Backups and backup metadata for all target databases is managed by a central recovery catalog (the Recovery Appliance catalog) on Recovery Appliance.">Recovery Manager Architecture</a></p>

For example, the RMAN client on Linux is located in $ORACLE_HOME/bin.You can create database connections from the RMAN client or the operating system command line. These database connection can be authenticated using a password file or with operating system authentication.To perform useful work, the RMAN client must connect to a database.Users connecting with RMAN to a target or auxiliary database require either the SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP system privilege. RMAN connections to a target or auxiliary database can be made using operating system authentication.Use a password file for either local or remote access. If a database uses a password file to authenticate administrative users, then RMAN can connect using a password.If you start RMAN without a connect string on the operating system command line, then you must issue a CONNECT TARGET command at the RMAN prompt to connect to a target database.To connect to a target database from the operating system command line, enter the rman command followed by the connection information. You can begin executing commands after the RMAN prompt is displayed.You can connect the RMAN client to multitenant container databases (CDBs) and pluggable databases (PDBs).You can perform RMAN operations on a whole CDB, the root only, or one or more PDBs. Certain restrictions apply when you connect directly to a pluggable database (PDB):There are several ways to connect as target to the root. You can connect to a PDB either from the RMAN prompt or the operating system command line.You can make a database connection by creating an RMAN command file containing a CONNECT command..To use the DUPLICATE command, you must connect to an auxiliary instance. Performing tablespace point-in-time recovery (TSPITR) may also require a connection to an auxiliary instance.When you are diagnosing errors that RMAN encounters in connecting to the target, catalog and auxiliary databases, consider using SQL*Plus to connect to the databases directly. This action can reveal underlying problems with the connection information or the databases.RMAN connects to target and auxiliary databases using the SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP privilege. Thus, when you use SQL*Plus to diagnose connection problems to the target or auxiliary databases, request a SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP connection to reproduce RMAN behavior.Use SQL*Plus to diagnose recovery catalog connection problems.By default, RMAN writes command output to standard output. To redirect output to a log file, enter the LOG parameter on the command line when you start RMAN.Before invoking RMAN, it may be useful to set the NLS_DATE_FORMAT and NLS_LANG environment variables. These variables determine the format used for the time parameters in RMAN commands such as RESTORE, RECOVER, and REPORT.When the RMAN client is ready for your commands, it displays the command promptFor repetitive tasks, you can create a text file containing RMAN commands, and start the RMAN client with the @ argument, followed by a file name.The comment character in RMAN is a pound sign (#). All text from the pound sign to the end of the line is ignored. When running a command file, you can specify one or more values in a USING clause for use in substitution variables in a command file. In this way, you can make your command files dynamic.You can test RMAN commands for syntactic correctness without executing them. Use the command-line argument CHECKSYNTAX to start the RMAN client in a mode in which it only parses the commands that you enter and returns an RMAN-00558 error for commands that are not legal RMAN syntax.You can check the syntax of RMAN commands interactively without actually executing the commands.To test commands in a command file, start RMAN with the CHECKSYNTAX parameter and use the @ command to name the command file to be passed.The RMAN pipe interface is an alternative method for issuing commands to RMAN and receiving the output from those commands. Using this interface, it is possible to write a portable programmatic interface to RMAN.This example assumes that the application controlling RMAN wants to run multiple commands in succession. After each command is sent down the pipe and executed and the output returned, RMAN pauses and waits for the next command.This example assumes that the application controlling RMAN wants to run one or more commands as a single job. After running the commands that are on the pipe, RMAN exits."> Starting and Interacting with the RMAN&nbsp;Client </a></p>

You can modify the value of default parameters or override these values for a particular session.You can use the SHOW command to display the current value of RMAN configured settings for the target database. You can also view whether these commands are currently set to their default values.Backups for which no destination device type is specified are directed to the configured default device. RMAN is preconfigured to use disk as the default device type. No additional configuration is necessary.The BACKUP command can create either backup sets or image copies. For disk, you can configure RMAN to create either backup sets or image copies as its default backup type with the CONFIGURE DEVICE TYPE DISK BACKUP TYPE TO command. An RMAN channel is a connection to a database server session. RMAN uses channels to perform most tasks.Use the CONFIGURE CHANNEL command to configure options for disk or SBT channels. You can configure generic channel settings for a device type, that is, a template that is used for any channels created based on configured settings for that device.By default, RMAN allocates one disk channel for all operations. You can specify different options for this channel, for example, a new default location for backups.The number of channels available for a device type when you run a command determines whether RMAN reads or writes in parallel. As a rule, the number of channels used in executing a command should match the number of devices accessed. If you manually allocate a channel during a job, then RMAN disregards any configured channel settings.You can configure RMAN to automatically back up the control file and server parameter file. The autobackup occurs whenever a backup record is added.By default, the format of the autobackup file for all configured devices is the substitution variable %F in the FORMAT clause.The SET CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT command, which you can specify either within a RUN command or at the RMAN prompt, overrides the configured autobackup format in the current session only. On most platforms, to back up to and restore from sequential media such as tape you must integrate a media management software with your Oracle database. You can use Oracle Secure Backup, which supports both database and file system backups to tape, as your media manager. Before attempting to use RMAN with a media manager, determine the location of the media management library. After installing the media management software, perform the configuration required by your vendor so that the software can accept RMAN backups. After you have confirmed that the database server can load the media management library, test to ensure that RMAN can back up to the media manager. The ALLOCATE CHANNEL command is used to perform a basic test of RMAN communication with the media manager.After testing a channel allocation on the media manager, create and restore a test backup.Configuring SBT channels creates a persistent setting that is the default used for backup and recovery operations with a media manager.A backup piece name is determined by the FORMAT string specified in the BACKUP command, CONFIGURE CHANNEL command, or ALLOCATECHANNEL command.The easiest technique for backing up to a media manager is to configure automatic SBT channelsRMAN commands can be used to back up target databases to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance). Certain configuration steps are required to use the Recovery Appliance as a centralized repository for the target database backups.Before you can use RMAN to back up a target database to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance), you must install the Recovery Appliance backup module in the Oracle home of the target database.RMAN configuration is required before you can back up Oracle databases to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance).Before using RMAN to back up target databases to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance), you need to determine the location of the Recovery Appliance backup module on the target database host. This location is used while configuring or allocating RMAN channels for Recovery Appliance.The client configuration file, stored on the protected database, contains the configuration settings that are used by the Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance) backup module to communicate with the Recovery Appliance. This file is created automatically when the Recovery Appliance backup module is installed.The fast recovery area feature enables you to set up a disk area where the database can create and manage a variety of files related to backup and recovery. Use of the fast recovery area is strongly recommended. Consider configuring a fast recovery area as a first step in implementing a backup strategy.The fast recovery area can contain control files, online redo logs, archived redo logs, flashback logs, and RMAN backups. The fast recovery area can be used with Oracle Managed Files (OMF) and Automatic Storage Management (ASM)Space in the fast recovery area is balanced among backups and archived logs that must be kept according to the retention policy, and other files that may be subject to deletion. You enable the fast recovery area by setting two initialization parameters. These parameters enable the fast recovery area with or without having to shut down and restart the database instance.The larger the fast recovery area is, the more useful it becomes. Ideally, the fast recovery area is large enough to contain the control files, online redo logs, archived redo logs, and flashback logs. It should be able to contain a copy of all data files in the database and the incremental backups used by your chosen backup strategy.Use database initialization parameters to set the location and size of the fast recovery area.You can use the ALTER SYSTEM command to disable the fast recovery area.Use initialization parameters to configure the default locations for control files and redo logs. The initialization parameters CONTROL_FILES, DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_n, DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST, and DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST all interact to determine the location where the database control files are created.Oracle recommends that you the use fast recovery area as an archiving location because the archived logs are automatically managed by the database. Certain RMAN commands or implicit actions (such as control file autobackups) can create files in the fast recovery area. The backup retention policy specifies which backups must be retained to meet your data recovery requirements.The REDUNDANCY parameter of the CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY command specifies how many full or level 0 backups of each data file and control file that RMAN keeps. The default retention policy is REDUNDANCY 1.The RECOVERY WINDOW parameter of the CONFIGURE command specifies the number of days between the current time and the earliest point of recoverability.When you disable the retention policy, RMAN does not consider any backup as obsolete.Run the RMAN CONFIGURE command to enable and disable backup optimization. Backup optimization skips the backup of files in certain circumstances if the identical file or an identical version of the file has been backed up.When you enable backup optimization, the BACKUP command skips backing up files when the identical file has been backed up to the specified device type.Backup optimization is not always applied when backing up to SBT devices.By default, backup optimization is configured to OFF. You can use the SHOW BACKUP OPTIMIZATION command to view the current settings of backup optimization.You can use RMAN to create a persistent configuration that governs when archived redo logs are eligible for deletion from disk.You can use the CONFIGURE ARCHIVELOG DELETION POLICY command to specify when archived redo logs are eligible for deletion.By default, there is no archived redo log deletion policy and this is why the archive redo log policy is set to the NONE clause.You can use the CONFIGURE ARCHIVELOG DELETION POLICY BACKED UP integer TIMES TO DEVICE TYPE command to enable an archived log deletion policy. This configuration specifies that archived logs are eligible for deletion only when the specified number of archived log backups exist on the specified device type.By default the archived redo log deletion policy is set to NONE.If you use RMAN in a Data Guard environment, then you can use the CONFIGURE command to register and configure settings for the physical databases in this environment."> Configuring the RMAN Environment</a></p>

In addition to configuring parameters that apply to all channels of a particular type, you can also use the CONFIGURE command to configure parameters that apply to one specific channel. The PARALLELISM setting is not constrained by the number of specifically configured channels. Backup options enable you to control aspects such as backup size, backup compression, and backup encryption.The CONFIGURE MAXSETSIZE command limits the size of backup sets created on a channel. This CONFIGURE setting applies to any channel, whether manually allocated or configured, when the BACKUP command is used to create backup sets. The default value is given in bytes and is rounded down to the lowest kilobyte value.Backup piece size is an issue when it exceeds the maximum file size permitted by the file system or media management software. You can use the MAXPIECESIZE parameter of the CONFIGURE CHANNEL or ALLOCATE CHANNEL command to limit the size of backup pieces.Use the CONFIGURE ... BACKUP COPIES command to specify how many copies of each backup piece are created on the specified device type for the specified type of file. This type of backup is known as a duplexed backup set.Sometimes you may want to omit a specified tablespace from part of the regular backup schedule. Use the CONFIGURE command to configure tablespace exclusion.RMAN supports precompression processing and binary compression of backup sets. The CONFIGURE COMPRESSION ALGORITHM command enables you to configure compression options.Better backup compression ratios are achieved by consolidating the free space in each data block, and setting that free space to binary zeroes. This precompression processing stage has the most benefit for data blocks that have been the subject of many deletes and inserts operations. Conversely, it has no effect on data blocks that are still in their initial loaded state.Oracle Database provides two categories of compression algorithms: a default compression algorithm and a group of compression algorithms available with the Oracle Advanced Compression option.Use the CONFIGURE command to configure the default compression algorithm, which does not require the Oracle Advanced Compression option.For improved security, you can configure backup encryption for RMAN backup sets. Encrypted backups cannot be read if they are obtained by unauthorized users.The V$RMAN_ENCRYPTION_ALGORITHMS view contains a list of encryption algorithms supported by RMAN. If no encryption algorithm is specified, then the default encryption algorithm is 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).Transparent encryption can create and restore encrypted backups with no DBA intervention, if the required Oracle key management infrastructure is available. Password encryption requires that the DBA provide a password when creating and restoring encrypted backups. Restoring a password-encrypted backup requires the same password that was used to create the backup.Dual-mode encrypted backups can be restored either transparently or by specifying a password. You can use the CONFIGURE command to persistently configure transparent encryption of backups. You can use the CONFIGURE command to persistently configure the default algorithm to use for encryption when writing backup sets.You may want to set the names of data files in the auxiliary instance when performing operations such as data file tablespace point-in-time recovery (TSPITR) or data transfer with RMAN. You set these names before starting the TSPITR or database duplication.When RMAN needs a read-consistent version of the control file, it creates a temporary snapshot control file. RMAN needs a snapshot control file when resynchronizing with the recovery catalog or when making a backup of the current control file.You can see the current snapshot location by running the SHOW command. Use the CONFIGURE SNAPSHOT CONTROLFILE NAME TO 'filepath' command to change the name and path of the snapshot control file. Subsequent snapshot control files that RMAN creates use the specified name and path.RMAN cannot connect to a target database through a shared server dispatcher. RMAN requires a dedicated server process. A data block lost write occurs when an I/O subsystem acknowledges the completion of the block write, but the write did not occur in the persistent storage. On a subsequent block read, the I/O subsystem returns the stale version of the data block, which might be used to update other blocks of the database, thereby corrupting it.Shadow lost write protection provides fast detection and immediate response to a data block lost rewrite thereby minimizing data loss and database repair time. A standby database is not mandatory for using shadow lost write protection."> Configuring the RMAN Environment: Advanced Topics</a></p>

It enables you to return a database to its state at a time in the recent past. Flashback Database is much faster than point-in-time recovery because it does not require restoring data files from backup and requires applying fewer changes from the archived redo logs.The range of SCNs for which there is currently enough flashback log data to support the FLASHBACK DATABASE command is called the flashback database window. The flashback database window cannot extend further back than the earliest SCN in the available flashback logs.Because Flashback Database works by undoing changes to the data files that exist at the moment when you run the command, it has certain limitations.Creating a normal restore point assigns a restore point name to an SCN or specific point in time.Like a normal restore point, a guaranteed restore point serves as an alias for an SCN in recovery operations. A principal difference is that guaranteed restore points never age out of the control file and must be explicitly dropped. In practice, guaranteed restore points provide a useful alternative to storage snapshots. You can create both normal and guaranteed restore points in a multitenant environment. A CDB restore point serves as an alias for an SCN or a point in time in a multitenant container database (CDB). It can be a normal restore point or a guaranteed restore point. You can create normal and guaranteed restore points in a pluggable database (PDB). PDB restore points are accessible only to the PDB in which they are defined. Each pluggable database (PDB) has its own namespace for restore points. Therefore, you can define a PDB restore point with the same name in more than one PDB.Logging for Flashback Database and guaranteed restore points involves capturing images of data file blocks before changes are applied. The FLASHBACK DATABASE command can use these images to return the data files to their previous state.Certain rules govern the usage of space in the fast recovery area.If you enable Flashback Database and define one or more guaranteed restore points, then the database performs normal flashback logging. To ensure successful operation of Flashback Database and guaranteed restore points, you must first set some key database options.You can create, monitor, and drop both normal and guaranteed restore points.To create normal or guaranteed restore points, use the CREATE RESTORE POINT SQL statement, providing a name for the restore point and specifying whether it is to be a guaranteed restore point or a normal one (the default).The CREATE RESTORE POINT SQL command enables you to create normal and guaranteed restore points in a multitenant container database (CDB).You use the CREATE RESTORE POINT SQL statement to create restore points in a pluggable database (PDB).You can use the V$RESTORE_POINT control file view to obtain information about all currently-defined restore points (normal and guaranteed), including CDB restore points and PDB restore points.When you are satisfied that you do not need an existing restore point, or when you want to create a restore point with the name of an existing restore point, you can drop the restore point, using the DROP RESTORE POINT SQL*Plus statement. To use flashback logging for a target database, you must enable Flashback Database. Certain guidelines can be followed to ensure optimal performance of Flashback Database. Use the ALTER DATABASE command to enable Flashback DatabaseUse the ALTER DATABASE command to disable Flashback Database.Maintaining flashback logs imposes comparatively limited overhead on an database instance. Changed blocks are written from memory to the flashback logs at relatively infrequent, regular intervals, to limit processing and I/O overhead. Several data analysis methods are available to monitor the Flashback Database workload on your system.When flashback is enabled or when there are guaranteed restore points, the background process RVWR writes flashback data to flashback database logs in the fast recovery area.">Using Flashback Database and Restore Points</a></p>
