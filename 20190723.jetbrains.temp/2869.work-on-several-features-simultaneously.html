PyCharm provides you with        a few ways to conveniently work on several different features without losing your work:    </p>    <ul class="list _bullet"><li class="list__item" id="b277aeeb">            <p id="134a4396">            You can <a href="work-on-several-features-simultaneously.html#stash">stash</a> or <a href="work-on-several-features-simultaneously.html#shelve">shelve</a> pending changes.            </p>            <p id="edbbfa3d">                Stashing changes is very similar to shelving. The only difference is in the way patches are generated and applied.                Stashes are generated by Git, and can be applied from within PyCharm, or outside it.                Patches with shelved changes are generated by PyCharm and are also applied through the IDE.                Also, stashing involves all uncommitted changes, while when you put changes to a shelf, you can select some of the                local changes instead of shelving them all.            </p>        </li><li class="list__item" id="792dcbca"><p>            You can <a href="work-on-several-features-simultaneously.html#changelists">keep changes related to different tasks or features in different changelists</a>.        </p></li><li class="list__item" id="83d54be1"><p>            You can create <a href="work-on-several-features-simultaneously.html#feature-branches">branches to work on different unrelated features</a>.        </p></li></ul>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="shelve" data-toc="Work_on_several_features_simultaneously#shelve">Shelve changes</h2>                    <p id="2b19258d">                Shelving is temporarily storing pending changes you have not committed yet.
