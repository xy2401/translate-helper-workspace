<p>This section describes how to set up run configuration using Grid Engine as a target system configuration

<p>When running an Grid Engine program from PTP, first create a C/C++/Fortran project, and build it.
For more information, see
<ul>
<li><a href="../01buildMPIprog.html">Introduction to creating MPI projects</a>
which includes information on building
<li><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.pldt.doc.user/html/setup.html">Setting up an MPI project with PTP's PLDT</a>
<li><a href="../sync.html">Synchronized Projects</a> - creating and building projects on remote machines
</ul> 
<p>As described in <a href="../03pRunConfig.html">Running Parallel Programs</a>, next create a run configuration
via Run > Run Configurations ... and create a new <b>Parallel Application</b>.
<p>The specifics for running an Grid Engine program with PTP are specified on
the <b>Resources</b> tab of the run configuration.
For <b>Target System Configuration</b>, select <b>Grid Engine-Generic-Batch</b>
<p><img src="../images/ge-rm.png">
<p>Then specify a connection.  If you have already specified a connection, e.g.
for a <a href="../sync.html">Synchronized Project</a> or a remote project,
it will be selected already.
If you are launching a local application (on the same machine where Eclipse is running), 
select <b>Local</b> for the <b>Connection Type</b>.

<p>See <a href="../remoteTools.html#create">Creating Remote Connections</a> and 
<a href="../remoteTools.html#local">Local Connections</a>

<p>Note: To edit connection information after a connection has been created, e.g. to change user name or password, see
the Remote Services section on 
<a href="../remoteTools.html#edit">Editing Remote Connections</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>Fill in the Grid Engine options, as appropriate for your system, in the <b>Grid Engine Settings</b> tab.
<p><img src="../images/ge-settings.png">
<p>Now continue with the 
<a href="../03pRunConfig.html#application">run configuration setup for running your parallel application</a> by specifying the Application program
on the <b>Application</b> tab, and any other information required.
