<h2><a name="ds">Why aren't provisioning related services available in my application?</a></h2>
<p>
	OSGi services provided by p2 and Update Manager are now registered using the
	OSGi declarative services mechanism. If you are writing your own application
	that makes use of these services, you need to make sure the declarative
	services bundle (<tt>org.eclipse.equinox.ds</tt>), is being started in your application.

<h2><a name="p2api">How do I migrate from the provisional p2 API in 3.5 to the new p2 API in 3.6?</a></h2>
<p>
	In the 3.4 and 3.5 releases, p2 provided a provisional API for accessing its
	functionality programmatically. This provisional API has largely been replaced in
	the 3.6 release with a fully supported mature p2 API. While there is generally 
	no migration support for clients who used provisional APIs, you can find some
	help with migration on the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Equinox/p2/Helios_Migration_Guide">p2 Helios Migration Guide</a>.
