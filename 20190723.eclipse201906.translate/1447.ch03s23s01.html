              This report shows a list of executed, relevant Test
              Suites over the time period selected. For each day in
              the time period, there is a colored block for the Test
              Suite to display its status. Green means that the test
              ran without any errors. Red means that the test ran,
              but with errors. Yellow means that the test ran more
              than once on that day. White means that the Test Suite
              did not run on this day. This report is useful for
              teams with large amounts of Test Suites who need to
              ensure on a daily basis that all Test Suites were
              started. Test Suites that were not run at all during
