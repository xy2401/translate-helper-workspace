<title>Installing software using the p2 director application</title>
</head>
<body>

<h1>Installing software using the p2 director application</h1>
In addition to the "Software Updates" dialog, you can also perform
provisioning operations from a command line or script. 
This is achieved using a tool called the director application. The director application 
is a command line tool for installing additional software or uninstalling
software from an Eclipse-based product. This application is capable of provisioning a
complete installation from scratch or simply extending your application.
Depending on your needs, this application can be executed both inside and
outside of the target product being provisioned.

<h2>Terminology</h2>
<ul>
	<li><b>Director application:</b> the application performing p2
	operations such as install or uninstall. This application is provided
	by the org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director.app bundle.</li>
	<li><b>Provisioning operation:</b> an operation installing,
	uninstalling features.</li>
	<li><b>Target product:</b> the installation targeted by the
	provisioning operation.</li>
	<li><b>Builder:</b> an eclipse based application containing the
	director application bundle and its dependents.</li>
</ul>
<br>

<h2>Running inside the target application</h2>
<p>In this mode, the provisioning operation happens from within the
targeted product that you are provisioning. It is equivalent to starting
up the targeted product and using the p2 UI to perform the equivalent
operation.</p>
<p>This means that the target application has to be in a runnable
state and has to contain the director application bundle. Also, since the
target product will have run, cache files will have been created in the
configuration folder (e.g. configuration/org.eclipse.osgi).</p>
<p>The following example shows the command line used to install CDT
into the SDK.</p>
<pre>
<code>
  &lt;targetProductFolder&gt;/eclipsec.exe 
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director 
   -repository http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios/
   -installIU org.eclipse.cdt.feature.group/&lt;version&gt;
</code>
</pre>

<h2>Provisioning without running the target application</h2>
<p>In this case the provisioning operation happens "outside" of
the targeted product. The "targeted product" is *not* started. This
allows one to both modify an existing installation and create a complete
installation from scratch given proper metadata.</p>

<p>This also has the advantage that since the targeted product does
not need to be started, the provisioning operation can be performed on
any platform for any other platform (e.g. on my linux machine, one can
add plug-ins to a windows-based target application).</p>

<h3>Installing / uninstalling IUs into a target product</h3>
<p>To install or uninstall something into an existing target product
a few extra arguments than for the "inside" mode need to be set. These
mostly consist in providing the provisioning operation the ID of the
profile it needs to operate on, and where it is located on disk.</p>

<p>For example, if from a directory called "d:\builder" containing
the builder, you want to install CDT into an existing SDK located into
"d:\eclipse", you would use the following command line.</p>
<pre>
<code>
   d:\builder\eclipsec.exe
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director
   -repository http://download.eclipse.org/releases/helios/
   -installIU org.eclipse.cdt.feature.group
   -tag AddCDT
   -destination d:/eclipse/
   -profile SDKProfile</code>
</pre>
<p>Note that there is no need to describe the os/ws/arch of the
platform being targeted because all this information is already 
available in the profile of the application in which we are
provisioning.</p>

<h3>Installing a complete product</h3>
<p>The creation of a complete product using the director application
only needs a few extra arguments compared to the previous example. Most of these
consist of values used to initialize the profile in which the
application will be provisioned.</p>

<p>The following example demonstrates how to create a linux/gtk
installation of the Eclipse SDK provisioned into a folder called "d:\eclipse" using
a director application located in "d:\builder".</p>

<pre>
<code>
   d:\builder\eclipsec.exe
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director
   -repository http://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/updates/3.6
   -installIU org.eclipse.sdk.ide
   -tag InitialState
   -destination d:/eclipse/
   -profile SDKProfile
   -profileProperties org.eclipse.update.install.features=true
   -bundlepool d:/eclipse/
   -p2.os linux
   -p2.ws gtk
   -p2.arch x86
   -roaming
 </code>
</pre>
<p>The -p2.* arguments describe the os/ws/arch that the provisioned
product is targeting.</p>
<h3>Installing a complete product for macOS</h3>
<p>The creation of a complete product for the macOS Operating System requires
that the destination folder end with ".app/" as in the following example.

<pre>
 <code> 
   d:\builder\eclipsec.exe
   -nosplash
   -application org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director
   -repository http://download.eclipse.org/releases/mars
   -installIU org.eclipse.sdk.ide
   -tag InitialState
   -destination d:/eclipse/MyApp.app/
   -profile SDKProfile
   -profileProperties org.eclipse.update.install.features=true
   -p2.os macosx
   -p2.ws cocoa
   -p2.arch x86_64
   -roaming
 </code>
</pre>
<p>For a macOS App product, you may also want to edit the Info.plist file, such as to 
change CFBundleName to the name of your product.
<h2>Arguments Description</h2>
<ul>
<li><b>-application
org.eclipse.equinox.p2.director</b>: the application ID.</li>
<li><b>-metadataRepository</b>: a comma separated list of
metadata repository URLs where the software to be installed can be
found.</li>
<li><b>-artifactRepository</b>: a comma separated list of
artifact repository URLs where the software artifacts can be found.</li>
<li><b>-repository</b>: a comma separated list of repository URL where 
  each entry denotes colocated meta-data and artifact repositories.</li>
<li><b>-installIU</b>: a comma separated list of IUs to install. Each entry in the list is in the form &lt;id&gt; [ '/' &lt;version&gt; ].
If you are looking to install a feature, the identifier of
the feature has to be suffixed with ".feature.group".</li>
<li><b>-uninstallIU</b>: a comma separated list of IUs to uninstall. Each entry in the list is in the form &lt;id&gt; [ '/' &lt;version&gt; ].</li>
<li><b>-revert</b>: Revert the installation to a previous state. The previous state can either be a tag (see -tag / -listtags) or a previous profile state [ the number representing the previous state of the profile  as found in p2/org.eclipse.equinox.p2.engine/&lt;profileId&gt;/ ].</li>
<li><b>-purgeHistory</b>: Remove the history of the profile registry.</li>
<li><b>-destination</b>: the path of a folder in which the targeted
product is located. For "macosx", it must end with ".app/".</li>
<li><b>-list</b>: lists all IU's found in the given repositories in a property like format. The optional arguments can be an comma separated list of entries where each entry is in the form &lt;id&gt; [ '/' &lt;version&gt; ], or a p2 QL query prefixed with Q:, or Q:group as shortcut for groups.</li>
<li><b>-listTags</b>: list all the tags found for the given profile.</li>
<li><b>-listInstalledRoots</b>: list all the roots IUs found in the given profile. Each entry is the list in the form id / version</li>
<li><b>-listFormat</b>: formats the list of IUs according to the given string. Use ${&lt;property&gt;} to access IU properties, e.g. ${org.eclipse.equinox.p2.name} for the IU's name. ID and version of an IU are available through ${id} and ${version}.</li>
<li><b>-profile</b>: the profile id containing the
description of the targeted product. This ID is is defined by the 
<tt>eclipse.p2.profile</tt> property contained in the config.ini of the targeted
product. For the Eclipse SDK the ID is "SDKProfile"</li>
<li><b>-profileProperties</b>: a comma separated list of &lt;key&gt;=&lt;value&gt;
pair. The property org.eclipse.update.install.features=true will cause
the update manager features to be installed.</li>
<li><b>-bundlepool</b>: the location of where the plug-ins and features will be stored. This value is
only taken into account when a new profile is created. For an
application where all the bundles are located into the plugins/ folder
of the destination, set it to &lt;destination&gt;.</li>
<li><b>-p2.os</b>: the OS to use when the profile is created.
This will be used to filter which OS specific installable units need to
be installed.</li>
<li><b>-p2.ws</b>: the windowing system to use when the
profile is created. This will be used to filter which WS specific
installable units need to be installed.</li>
<li><b>-p2.arch</b>: the architecture to use when the profile
is created. This will be used to filter which architecture specific
installable units need to be installed.</li>
<li><b>-roaming</b>: indicates that the product resulting
from the installation can be moved. This property only makes sense when
the destination and bundle pool are in the same location. This value is only taken
into account when the profile is created.</li>
<li><b>-shared</b>: use a shared location for the install. The path defaults to ${user.home}/.p2.</li>
<li><b>-tag</b>: a label. This allows to tag the profile state resulting from the operation being executed. </li>
<li><b>-verifyOnly</b>: only verify that the actions can be performed. Don't actually install or remove anything.</li>
</ul>
While doing these operations, you can disable the automatic mirror selection mechanism by setting the VM argument eclipse.p2.mirrors to false.
