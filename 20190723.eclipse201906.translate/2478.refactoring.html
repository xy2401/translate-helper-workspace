Implementing an extract method refactoring on the variable $my_form in the following code:

Will result in the following code being created (the changes have been highlighted):

"Refactoring is a disciplined technique for restructuring an existing body of code, altering its internal structure without changing its external behavior. Its heart is a series of small behavior preserving transformations. Each transformation (called a 'refactoring') does little, but a sequence of transformations can produce a significant restructuring. Since each refactoring is small, it's less likely to go wrong. The system is also kept fully working after each small refactoring, reducing the chances that a system can get seriously broken during the restructuring."</p><div class="links"><h4 id="related-links">Related Links:</h4><ul><li><a href="../tasks/using_refactoring/index.html">Using Refactoring</a></li><li><a href="../tasks/using_refactoring/renaming_files.html">Renaming Files</a></li><li><a href="../tasks/using_refactoring/renaming_elements.html">Renaming Elements</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer">
