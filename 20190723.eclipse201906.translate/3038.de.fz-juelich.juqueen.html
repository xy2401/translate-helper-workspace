<h1 id="top">Running batch jobs on JUQUEEN</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Expertise/Supercomputers/JUQUEEN/JUQUEEN_node.html">JUQUEEN</a>
is a computing resource at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre.
<p>In order to run a batch job on JUQUEEN from PTP, first create a C/C++/Fortran project, and build it.
For more information, see
<ul>
<li><a href="../01buildMPIprog.html">Introduction to creating MPI projects</a>
which includes information on building
<li><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.pldt.doc.user/html/setup.html">Setting up an MPI project with PTP's PLDT</a>
<li><a href="../sync.html">Synchronized Projects</a> - creating and building projects on remote machines
</ul> 
<p>As described in <a href="../03pRunConfig.html">Running Parallel Programs</a>, next create a run configuration
via Run &gt; Run Configurations ... and create a new <b>Parallel Application</b>.

<p>Choose <b>de.fz-juelich.juqueen.ll_bg</b> as target system configuration.</p>

<p>JUQUEEN is an IBM Blue Gene/Q system. Its target system configuration is based on the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rm.ibm.ll.doc.user/html/IBMLLMainHelp.html">IBM LoadLeveler (Blue Gene)</a> target system configuration.
General Settings for a job submission on JUQUEEN are shown in the following snap shot.</p>

<p>
Except for the <b>E-mail</b> parameter used for notifications on job completions, all parameters can be found in the IBM LoadLeveler (Blue Gene) target system configuration.
On a Blue Gene system you usually have to select job type <b>bluegene</b>. With <b>Ranks per Node</b> the number of
processes per compute node are set.
</p>

<p>
Moreover, the location for in- and output files can be configured as shown in the following snap shot.
In the shown case, the standard output and standard error files are named dynamically. The variables
<b>host</b>, <b>jobid</b> and <b>stepid</b> will be replaced with the corresponding values for each job.

<p>
The limits section allows for instance to provide a wall clock limit.  
</p>

<p>
By filling in the shown parameters, the following batch script is generated.
</p>

<p>
You can always adapt the parameter values and check the produced job script afterwards by clicking on the
<b>View Script</b> button.
</p>

<p>
Finally, you have to select the binary, which has to be executed, on the <b>Application</b> tab.
Once your configuration is complete, you can click on the <b>Run</b> button to submit your job.
</p>
<p>For more information see the 
<a href="../03pRunConfig.html#application">run configuration setup for running your parallel application</a> 
which also describes specifying the Application program
on the <b>Application</b> tab, and specifying any other information required.
