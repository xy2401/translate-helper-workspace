<p>
    Our approach lets you automate tests which follow the best
    practices known from software development (readability,
    modularity and reusability to ensure maintainability), but
    without any programming effort.
  </p>
<p>
    This gives the following advantages:

<a name="early-test-creation"></a>1.2.5.1. Early test creation</h4></div></div></div>
<p>
      Tests are created before the AUT is available. This is a radical advantage over capture-replay tools, which force testers to wait until an application is ready to begin with testing. The specification of modular, flexible GUI tests begins early (even as early as at the requirements stage) and continues alongside software development.
    </p>
<p>
      The benefit of this is that every version of an AUT can be tested as soon as it becomes available. Testing keeps up with development, so you waste no time in your test process. Earlier testing lets you find issues when they are cheaper and easier to fix and encourages collaboration and communication within the team.

<p>
      Tests are automated completely from the user perspective and require no programming effort.
    </p>
<p>
      This means that those who understand the user perspective best
      are able to fully automate tests. There is no need to wait for
      input (e.g. programmatic creation of test modules) from other
      team members to automate a test. If developers are writing
      tests, the black box perspective encourages them to think like a
      user would when faced with the software. Code-free tests also
      have the advantage that they are readable by the whole team and
      also by users or customers.

<p>
      The wide range of keywords available include high-level actions
      which can be meaningfully used by testers. There is also a wide
      range of check and synchronization actions to incorporate the
      necessary robustness into a test.
