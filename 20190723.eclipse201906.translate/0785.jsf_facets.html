<h1>JSF Facets</h1>
<br>
A Facet is an Eclipse WebTools Project concept which essentially means a capability attached to an Eclipse project.   For more information see WST WTP Facets documentation.   The JSF Facet, therefore, supplies behaviours and capabilities that are associated with JSF.   Most of the features offered by the JSF Tooling project require that the JSF Facet be installed.

In order to use JSF tooling capabilities, a project must have the following pre-requisite facets:
<ul>
<li>Dynamic Web Module v2.3 or greater</li>
<li>Java v1.4 or greater</li>
</ul>

<br>
The following features are available when the JSF facet is installed:
<ul>
<li>JSF Library configuration support</li>
<li>Application Configuration Management</li>
<li>JSP Source Page semantic validation and content assist for most of the JSF Core and JSF HTML tag library attribute values using Expression Language (EL) or not.</li>
<li>"Run on Server" support of a JSF JSP page</li>
</ul>
<br>
<p><b>Note:</b> when a WAR file that contains a JSF Web module is imported as a project, the technology currently is unable to detect this.   It will be necessary to manually add the JSF Facet to the imported project.</p>
