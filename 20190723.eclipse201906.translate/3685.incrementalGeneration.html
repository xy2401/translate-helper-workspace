    As projects become larger, so typically do their models. However, the larger
    the models are, the longer the code generation process takes. In a mature
    project, a developer typically changes only a small part of a large model.
    Performing a full code generation process for the whole model slows down the
    development cycle considerably due to various factors:
    
    </p>
<div class="itemizedlist">
<ul class="itemizedlist" type="disc">
<li class="listitem">
        The whole model must be traversed, and each statement in the Xpand
        templates must be executed. The larger the model is and the more Xpand
        templates you have, the higher the negative impact is.
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        All generated files are written to disk. The I/O operation itself is
        one major contributor to the overall elapsed time. What's more, files
        are typically post-processed by beautifiers, which is another time
        consuming operation. If you are working with protected regions, the
        impact is even more dramatic.
      </li>
<li class="listitem">
        Since every file has a new timestamp after code generation, typically
        a compiler will pick up these new files and start compilation, which
        adds more CPU and I/O cycles to the process.
      </li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>
    
    Considering that for a small change in the model only a fraction of the
    generated files actually do change their contents, performing a full
    generation is obviously a waste of time.
  </p>
<p>
    Beginning with the Helios release train (Eclipse 3.6, Xpand 0.8), Xpand
    now ships with an incremental generation facility. This works very similar
    to the incremental Java compiler in Eclipse. It detects which parts of a
    model have changed since the last generation process. It then
    determines which files need to be generated due to that change and which
    are unaffected by it. Only the former are the regenerated, while the
    latter remain untouched.
  </p>
<p>
    The following sections explain how this incremental generation feature
    works and how you can use it.

      The key to incremental generation lies in knowing which element in a model
      was used to generate which file. This information can easily be computed
      during generation, by tracking which parts of the model are
      accessed in the context of any given
      <code class="code">«FILE»</code> statement. A callback for the
      Xpand generator does this job and builds up a so-called
      <span class="emphasis">
<em>trace model</em>
</span> on-the-fly.
    </p>
<p>
      The second important information is the actual change that has occurred
      in a model. There are basically two ways to compute this. One is to
      attach a change listener when editing the model and capture the change
      as it happens. The other way is to keep a backup copy of the model and
      compare the old version with the current version to compute the change.
      See <a class="xref" href="incrementalGeneration_notes.html#incrementalGeneration_performance" title="Performance Considerations">the section called “Performance Considerations”</a>
      for pros and cons of each of the two ways. In either
      case, the result is a so-called <span class="emphasis">
<em>diff model</em>
</span>.
    </p>
<p>
      When we know which parts of a model have changed, and we also know which
      files have been produced based upon these parts of the model, we can then
      skip the generation of all other files, thus performing incremental
      generation.
