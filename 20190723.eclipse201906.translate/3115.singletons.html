  <h1>Singletons and Static Fields in RAP</h1>

  <p>
    The classical singleton pattern suggests that a class has only one instance and keeps the
    reference to this instance in a static field.
    In RAP, <strong>this pattern is dangerous</strong>, because static values are kept in the
    <i>class</i>, which is shared among different user sessions and different applications.
    As an example, if a copy of the user's shopping cart is kept as a singleton, this would
    work on the desktop, but in RAP, all users would share the same shopping cart instance.
  </p>
  <p>
    Instead of using singletons and static fields, all data must be kept in the correct scope in RAP.
    RAP provides a helper class
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/SingletonUtil.html">SingletonUtil</a></em>
    that can create session-unique instances of a given class, so called <em>session singletons</em>.
    In the context of one UI session
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/SingletonUtil.html#getSessionInstance-java.lang.Class-">SingletonUtil.getSessionInstance( Class )</a></em>
    will always return the same object,
    but for different user sessions the returned instances will be different.
    The following code snippet illustrates this pattern:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
public class MySessionSingleton {
  private MySessionSingleton() {
    // prevent instantiation from outside
  }

  public static MySessionSingleton getInstance() {
    return SingletonUtil.getSessionInstance( MySessionSingleton.class );
  }

  // other methods ...
}
</pre>
  <p>
   <strong>Note</strong> that <em>SingletonUtil</em> can only be used in the context of a
   <a href="threads.html">UI session</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    Another way to replace static fields is to use one of RAP's
    <a href="data-stores.html">data stores</a>.
