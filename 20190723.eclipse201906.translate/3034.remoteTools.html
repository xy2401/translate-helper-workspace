<h1 id="top">Remote Services</h1>
<p>
Remote Services are a set of Eclipse plugins that provides a framework for accessing remote systems using a variety of protocols. Currently supported
protocols include SSH, Telnet, and Serial connections. PTP makes use of Remote Services in order to provide remote functionality such as Synchronized
Projects and remote launching and monitoring. The following sections will provide some information on creating and using connections to remote systems.

<h2 id="create">Creating Remote Connections</h2>
<p>New connections are typically created when a need for them arises, such as creating a remote or synchronized
project, or a run configuration on a remote target machine. Once a remote connection is created, it can be reused
any time remote access to the target machine is required.
<p>
There are generally two ways to create a new connection to a remote machine. Dialogs that allow connections to a remote system,
such as when creating a <a href="sync.html">synchronized project</a> using the <b>New Synchronized Project</b> wizard, generally provide
a <b>New...</b> button that opens the <b>New Connection</b> dialog. The second way is to use the <b>Add</b> button on the the 
<b>Remote Development > Remote Connections</b> preference page. This is described in the <a href="#prefs">Preferences</a> section below.
<p>
The following image  shows the <b>New Synchronized Project</b> wizard, which allows the user to choose a directory on a remote system
that will be synchronized. As can be seen, this part of the dialog contains a <b>New...</b> button which will open the <b>New Connection</b>
dialog as shown.
<p>

<p>
Select <b>New...</b> and use the <b>New Connection</b> dialog to specify a <b>Connection name</b>
of your choice and the address of the target system in the <b>Host</b> field. The fill in the <b>User</b>, and <b>Password</b>
or <b>Public key</b> fields as appropriate. Select
<b>Finish</b> to create the connection.

<h2 id="tunnel">SSH Proxy</h2>
<p>Sometimes it is necessary to connect via an intermediate host in order to reach a target system. This is typical in many high performance
computing installations. Tunneling via a proxy can be done either through the user interface, or by configuring a tunnel on the command line, and then using 
the tunnel for a remote connection. The command line interface to ssh is outside the scope of this document, but see the 
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/PTP/FAQ#Q:_How_do_I_use_PTP_to_connect_to_a_remote_system_via_an_intermediate_host_.28multi_hop.29">
PTP Wiki FAQ on tunneling</a> for how to set up the tunnel.
<p>
To configure an intermediate proxy using the <b>New Connection</b> dialog, enter the <b>Connection name</b>, <b>Host</b>, <b>User</b>, and authentication information
for the target system as previously. Next, open the <b>Advanced</b> section of the dialog as shown below. 
<p>
<img src="images/proxy.png">
<p>
In the <b>SSH Proxy Settings</b> section, select the 
<b>Remote</b> radio button, then either select an existing connection or create a new connection to the <i>intermediate host</i>. Once this has been
done, the proxy will be configured and this connection will be used whenever a connection is required to the target host. Note that when the
connection is opened, you may be asked for two sets of credentials (the intermediate and target hosts), depending on your connection settings.
<p>
When using a manually configured ssh tunnel, the <b>Host</b> will normally be configured to be <b>localhost</b>. The <b>Advanced</b> section will be used to change the 
<b>Port</b> setting. Choose a port number that corresponds to the port specified for the manually configured the ssh tunnel. The other entries in the
<b>Advanced</b> section should be remain the default values.

<h2 id="edit">Editing Remote Connections</h2>
<p>To edit remote connection information after a connection is created, e.g. to change userid, password, etc.,
open the Eclipse <b>Preferences</b> dialog, thenb select the <b>Remote Development > Remote Connections</b> page.

<p><img src="images/prefs_remoteDevConnections.png">
 

<p>To edit a connection, it must first be closed if it is open(running).  To close a connection, select it and use the <b>Close</b>
button.

<p>Once stopped, edit the connection via the <b>Edit</b> button.

<p>Then make any changes to the connection and select <b>Finish</b>
<p><img src="images/rt_editConnection.png">
<p>The connection need not be manually restarted (re-opened).  It will automatically open the next
time that communication with the target machine is needed.


<p>

<h2 id="remove">Removing Remote Connections</h2>
<p>To remove a connection, select it in the <b>Connections</b> page of the Preferences page as described above, 
and select <b>Remove</b>.

<h2 id="shell">Shell access to Remote systems</h2>
<p>For convenient shell access to a remote system within an Eclipse view, see <a href="remoteTerminal.html">Remote Terminal</a>.

<h2 id="default">Default Remote Services Provider</h2>
<p>By default, Remote Services is configured to use <b>SSH</b> as the default provider. This will avoid the user having
to specify which Remote Service Provider to use when creating a connection. The
<b>Preferences > Remote Development</b> preference page can be used to override the default selection if desired. Setting
the default provider to <b>None</b> will force the selection of a provider whenever a new connection is created.
