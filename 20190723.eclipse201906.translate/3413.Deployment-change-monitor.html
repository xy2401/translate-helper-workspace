<h2 id="_purpose_of_the_monitor">Purpose of the monitor</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The code generator produces simulation code for a DeploymentElement given to it. To decide whether a source file for a model element needs to be generated or not is beyond its responsibility. For this reason a DeploymentChangeMonitor is introduced and should be used during the behavior code generation process. This monitor tracks the changes of the model and is able to feed the generator with the DeploymentElements for which source code generation or re-generation is required. This solution will make overall time spent on code generation shorter, because only the changed model parts are considered.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The change monitor aggregates modifications into a delta between checkpoints. The API allows creating a new checkpoint and will provide the delta between the previous and newly created checkpoints, while it also starts to record the delta starting from the new checkpoint. The delta contains a boolean value to signify that the top-level configuration has to be re-generated and three sets of elements:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Appeared</strong> since the last checkpoint: source code related to these elements has to be generated, clean up not required</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Disappeared</strong> since the last checkpoint: source code related to these elements should be cleaned up</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Updated</strong> since the last breakpoint: source code related to these elements has to be re-generated, clean up may be needed (e.g. file name will change)</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</div>
</div>
<div class="sect1">
<h2 id="_how_does_it_work">How does it work</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implemetation relies on the VIATRA Event-driven Virtual Machine (EVM). There are rules defined for the Deployment, DeploymentHost, DeploymentApplication and DeploymentBehavior types using VIATRA Query patterns. These rules describe the connections and properties of model elements that are to be monitored, and the DeploymentChangeMonitor keeps track of these changes. This is done by separate registered jobs for appear, update and disappear events.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The monitor inside stores three sets separately for appeared, updated and disappeared DeploymentElements, and a boolean flag is the Deployment is changed.</p>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The rules used for monitoring:</p>
</div>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Deployment is changed iff</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lists of host changed OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>IP of a contained Host is changed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>DeploymentHost is changed iff</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Its list of applications is changed OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Its IP changed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>DeploymentApplication is changed iff</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>Its ID changed OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The current state of its DeploymentBehavior changed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>
</li>
<li>
<p>DeploymentBehavior is changed iff</p>
<div class="ulist">
<ul>
<li>
<p>The list of its states changed OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The list of its transitions changed OR</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>For any transition the list of triggered transitions are changed</p>
</li>
</ul>
</div>

</ul>

<h2 id="_usage">Usage</h2>
<div class="sectionbody">
<div class="paragraph">
<p>The implementation class for the monitor is the <code><code>org.eclipse.viatra.query.examples.cps.xform.m2t.DeploymentChangeMonitor</code></code> Java class. To use it, an ViatraQueryEngine and a Deployment needed.</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>engine = ViatraQueryEngine.on(deployment);
monitor = new DeploymentChangeMonitor(deployment,engine);
monitor.startMonitoring();</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To get the change detlas a DeploymentChangeDelta DTO is returned by the getDeltaSinceLastCheckpoint() method of the monitor. This DTO also contains the information about the old names/IDs required for identifying the previously generated files that are to be deleted. This is in a map, that can be queried and used like in the code shown below:</p>
</div>
<div class="listingblock">
<div class="content">
<pre class="highlight"><code>String oldId = monitor.deltaSinceLastCheckpoint.oldNamesForDeletion.get(deploymentElement);</code></pre>
</div>
</div>
<div class="paragraph">
<p>To create a checkpoint in order to start collecting deltas to new empty collections the createCheckpoint() method can be used. This also returns a DeploymentChangeDelta containing all changes between the last two checkpoints.</p>
