<h1>JSF Design-Time Skinning Support</h1>
<p>
JSF Application developers use JSF components that support skins to give
their application a uniform look and feel. A Skin is typically one or
more CSS stylesheets with pre-defined selectors and often a set of
images that are referenced by the stylesheet(s). A JSF Component Library
that supports skinning would use these pre-defined selectors in
rendering the JSF component. The
<a href="http://myfaces.apache.org/trinidad/index.html">Apache
MyFaces Trinidad</a>
("Trinidad") JSF library supports skinning.
</p><p>
The Web Page Editor (WPE) has design-time support for skins. This allows
a JSF developer to visually see the effect of applying a particular skin
on a JSF page that has JSF components that support skinning.
