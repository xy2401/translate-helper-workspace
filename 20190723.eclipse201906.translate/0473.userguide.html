<p>
  EclEmma records which parts of your Java code are executed during a particular
  program launch. This technique is called <i>code coverage analysis</i> and
  typically used with automated testing like JUnit unit tests. It helps to
  identify untested parts of a code base and improve the corresponding tests.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="launching.html">Running</a> a coverage analysis is as simple as
  pressing a single button like the existing <i>Run</i> and <i>Debug</i>
  buttons. The coverage results are automatically summarized in the
  <a href="coverageview.html"><i>Coverage</i> view</a> and highlighted in the
  <a href="annotations.html">Java editors</a>.
