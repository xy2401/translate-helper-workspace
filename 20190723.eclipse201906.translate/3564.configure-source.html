		<h1>Configuring Source Folders</h1>
		<p>
			In order to limit the source files in the global scope of a JavaScript project, the JSDT supports specifying project source folders. 
			By default the project root is a source folder, so for most instances no source folder configuration is necessary.
		</p>
		<p>
			Depending on the kind of project, source is added to the global scope differently:
			<ul>
				<li>For a JavaScript project, source files (and sub folders) from a the default source folder are all added to the global scope by default</li>
				<li>For an HTML project there are is no default source folder. In this case, HTML files have their own global scope that is a combination of libraries from the project and any source files included through HTML using the <code>&lt;script src='...'&gt;</code> tag.</li>
			</ul>
		</p>
		<p>
			Source folders can be easily configured on the <strong>JavaScript > Include Path</strong> properties page on the <strong>Source</strong> tab.
