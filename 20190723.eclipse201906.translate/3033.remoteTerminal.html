<h1 id="top">PTP Remote Terminal</h1>
<p><b>Remote Terminal</b> is a lightweight remote terminal that can be used to provide shell access to remote systems from within Eclipse.
It is included with the Parallel Tools Platform (PTP) and uses the same connection information
that is used by remote and synchronized projects, including the default <a href="remoteTools.html">Built-in SSH</a>.

<p>The <b>Terminal</b> view should be available near the bottom of the workbench.

<p>
<img src="images/rterm_wbench.png">

<p>If you already have a connection and/or a synchronized project, you can open a <b>Terminal</b> 
<ul><li>
to the machine with which
the project is synchronized - by right-clicking on the project, then selecting "Show Terminal" from
the dropdown menu.
<li>to the machine with which any connection is established - in the <b>Terminal</b> view, select the <img src="images/rterm_icon_connect.png"> <b>Connect</b> 
button.
</li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>If the <b>Terminal</b> view  is not visible, you can open it via <b>Window > Show View > Other...</b>
and under <b>Terminal</b>, select <b>Terminal</b>.
<p>

<p>To open a shell directly from the <b>Terminal</b> view, select the <img src="images/rterm_icon_connect.png"> <b>Connect</b> 
button.
<p><img src="images/rterm_connect2.png"></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the next dialog, choose <b>Connection Type:</b> to use e.g. <b>Remote Services</b>,
and under <b>Settings</b>, select the connection to use. 
If you have not already established a connection, select <b>New...</b>
and enter hostname, user, password, etc.
For more information about creating connections, see <a href="remoteTools.html">Remote Services</a>.
<p><img src="images/rterm_connect1.png"></p>

<p>Select <b>OK</b> to open the shell on the selected system.
<p><img src="images/rterm_connected.png"></p>
<p>Shell commands can be entered on the selected system.
<p>&nbsp;

<h2 id="interact">Terminal/Eclipse Interaction</h2>

<p>It is possible for the shell and the terminal to interact, allowing the eclipse
user to have the best of both the command line and the GUI.</p>

<p>For example, a short command can call up the Eclipse editor from the command line:
<p><img src="images/rterm_ptpEdit.png">

<p>Commands are initiated by special strings, sometimes called "escape sequences."
These sequences are enumerated below:</p>
<ol>
<li><b>Open File:</b> The string "~~EPTP:OpenFile~~FileName\n" will cause the file
named to be opened inside the Eclipse browser. Note that only full path names will
work. If the file is part of a synchronized project, Eclipse will open the file as
a local file on the client machine. If it is not, it will open the file with an URL
using a "remotetools" protocol.</li>

<li><b>Choose a File:</b> The string "~~EPTP:Choice~~File1~~File2~~..~~FileN\n" will
open a dialog box in Eclipse and allow the user to choose one of the selected files
for opening.</li>

<li><b>Menu:</b> The string "~~EPTP:Radio~~MenuText1::~Command1~~MenuText2::~Command2.."
will create a dialog box with a sequence of radio buttons, labeled "MenuText1", "MenuText2",
etc. Choosing a given item and clicking OK will cause the corresponding command to be
sent to the shell and executed.</li>
</ol>

<p>It is convenient to invoke the above escape sequences through the use of scripts.
The following script is suggested for opening files on the remote machine. An example
follows:</p>

<pre>
#!/usr/bin/perl
use strict;
use File::Spec;
my @files = ();
my $aflag = 0;
for my $a (@ARGV) {
    if($a eq "-a") {
        $aflag = 1;
    } elsif(-r $a) {
        push @files, File::Spec-&gt;rel2abs($a);
    }
}
if($#files == 0) {
    print "~~EPTP:OpenFile~~",$files[0],"\n";
} elsif($aflag) {
    for my $file (@files) {
        print "~~EPTP:OpenFile~~",$file,"\n";
        sleep(1);
    }
} else {
    print "~~EPTP:Choice~~",join("~~",@files),"\n";
}
</pre>

<p>Using this script, it is possible to open any file within
the Eclipse editor by typing:</p>

<pre>  ptp filename</pre>

<p>Note that the file name can be relative or absolute.</p>

<h2 id="hist">Terminal History</h2>

<p>A new view is available called "Terminal History." To open
it type <b>Window > Show View > Other...</b>, and under the <b>Other</b> category, select "Terminal History."</p>

<p>If you opened any terminals using "Show Terminal" on any synchronized projects,
this view will show you your shell histories on the remote
machines. In order for this to work, however, you must add a
few special commands to your startup files on the remote machines.</p>

<ol>
<li><b>For Bash:</b> Add "history -a" to your ~/.bashrc</li>
<li><b>For Tcsh/Csh:</b> Add "set history=100;set savehist=100;alias precmd 'history -S'" to
your ~/.cshrc. Feel free to change the number "100" to whatever number of items you wish
to retain in your shell history.</li>
</ol>

<p><img src="images/rterm_term_hist.png" width="600"></p>

<p>As you type each new command, it will appear in the top of the history view,
pushing the older commands down.</p>

<ol>
<li>If you wish to keep one of the commands near
the top of the view, click the checkbox.</li>
<.i>If you wish to re-execute the command
from the history, click the numbered button at the left.</li>
<li>If you wish to delete
the command from the history, click the "X" button on the right.</li>
<li>If you wish to edit the command, click inside the text box containing it.</li>
</ol>

<h2 id="other">Other Features</h2>

<p>To create an additional view for another terminal connection use <b>New Terminal View</b>
from the dropdown menu next to the 
<img src="images/rterm_icon_newConn.png"> button in the view toolbar.
<p><img src="images/rterm_newTermView.png"></p>
<p>Then multiple <b>Terminal</b> views will exist, each with a different connection.
