<h1 class="topictitle1">Team support</h1>

<p>The team support model works with shared repositories that store
version-managed resources on servers that are accessible to the entire team. Usually
you would share the folders and files of an Eclipse project. Each
team member sends their changes to the repository, and receives changes
that
were made by a team member from the repository. While the Remote System
Explorer
is not project-based, (it is designed for direct access to remote
resources),
there is a single project created for all the non-remote resources that
the
Remote System Explorer manages. Profiles are stored in that project and
so everything that belongs to a profile can be
shared with your teammates.</p>
<div class="p"><a name="cteam__profilelist"><!-- --></a>Profiles
contain:
<ul>
  <li>Connections -- including various subsystem properties. User IDs
and passwords are not shared.</li>
  <li>Filters, filter pools, and filters pool references</li>
  <li>User-defined actions</li>
  <li>Compile commands</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p> Use the Team view of the Remote System Explorer perspective to
associate
and synchronize the project named RemoteSystemsConnection that contains
these profiles with a repository. After
synchronizing with the repository, you will receive all the shared
Remote System
Explorer resources from your team, including their profiles. You then
use the <b>Reload Remote System Explorer</b> action, located on the
pop-up menu, to make the Remote System Explorer know about these
changes. You can also, of course, quit and restart the
workbench. See the related tasks for more information.</p>
<p>Any resources received that are in a profile that you have already
active, such
as Team, will immediately be available and accessible to you. However,
resources
in other profiles will not be available unless you choose to make those
profiles
active. If you use multiple workstations, team support can also be used
to
make your own private configurations of filters, filter pools, and
connections available on all the workstations by making
your profile active on each workstation.</p>
