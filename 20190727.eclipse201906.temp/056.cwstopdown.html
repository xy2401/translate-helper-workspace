<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating top-down Web services</h1>



<div><p>Web services can be created using two methods: top-down development
and bottom-up development. Top-down Web services development involves creating
a Web service from a WSDL file.</p>

<p>When creating a Web service using a top-down approach, first you design
the implementation of the Web service by creating a WSDL file. You can do
this using the WSDL Editor. You can then use the Web services wizard to create
the Web service and skeleton Javaâ„¢ classes to which you can add the required
code.</p>

<p>Although bottom-up Web service development may be faster and easier, especially
if you are new to Web services, the top-down approach is the recommended way
of creating a Web service. By creating the WSDL file first you will ultimately
have more control over the Web service, and can eliminate interoperability
issues that may arise when creating a Web service using the bottom-up method.</p>
