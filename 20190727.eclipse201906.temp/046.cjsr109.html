<h1 class="topictitle1">JSR 109 - Implementing Enterprise Web services</h1>



<div><p>JSR 109 (Implementing Enterprise Web Services) defines the programming
model and run-time architecture to deploy and look up Web services in the
Java EE environment; more specifically, in the Web, EJB, and Client Application
containers. One of its main goals is to ensure vendors' implementations interoperate.</p>

<p>JSR 109 builds on top of JAX-RPC to cover the use of JAX-RPC in a Java
EE environment, as well as the implementation and deployment of Web services
to a Java EE application server. JSR 109 defines a set of XML-based deployment
descriptors to standardize Web services and Web service client deployments
in the Java EE environment. JSR 921 was a maintenance revision of JSR 109,
and has since been replaced by the updated version of JSR 109.</p>

<div class="parentlink"><strong>Parent topic:</strong> <a href="../concepts/cwsstandards.html" title="One of the key attributes of Internet standards is that they focus on protocols and not on implementations. The Internet is composed of heterogeneous technologies that successfully interoperate through shared protocols. This prevents individual vendors from imposing a standard on the Internet. Open Source software development plays a crucial role in preserving the interoperability of vendor implementations of standards.">Web services standards</a></div>

<div><a href="cjaxrpc.html" title="JAX-RPC stands for Java API for XML-based RPC, also known as JSR 101. It is a specification that describes Java Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) and conventions for building Web services and Web service clients that use remote procedure calls (RPC) and XML. It standardizes the Java to WSDL and WSDL to Java mappings, and provides the core APIs for developing Web services and Web service clients on the Java platform. Often used in a distributed client/server model, an RPC mechanism enables clients to execute procedures on other systems.">JAX-RPC</a></div></div>
