<div class="id_context"><p class="anchor_topictop" />
 <p>A
cyclical dependency between two or more modules in an enterprise application
most commonly occurs when projects are imported from outside the workbench.
When a cycle exists between two or more modules in an enterprise application,
the Javaâ„¢ builder
cannot accurately compute the build order of the projects. Full builds fail
under these conditions, or require several invocations.</p>
<p>Therefore, the
best practice is to organize your projects or modules into components. This
allows your module dependencies to function as a tree instead of a cycle diagram.
This practice has the added benefit of producing a better factored and layered
application.</p>
<p>To reorganize your project to correct cyclical dependencies,
complete the following steps:</p>
</div>

<ol class="id_steps">
<li><span>Identify all the classes within the JAR files that have cyclical
dependencies and move those classes into a common Java project or JAR file.</span></li>

<li><span>Use the enterprise application editor to map utility JAR files
to the common projects.</span></li>

<li><span>For each module of the JAR in the application, use the JAR dependency
editor or properties page to set dependencies only to the JAR files that are
truly required.</span></li>

</ol>
