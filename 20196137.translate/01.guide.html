<h1>Graphical Editing Framework Programmer's Guide</h1>
<p>
The Graphical Editing Framework (GEF) provides a foundation for building rich, 
interactive user interfaces which are not easily built using native widgets 
found in the base Eclipse platform.</p>
<p>This guide provides an architectural overview of the Graphical Editing 
Framework.&nbsp; The reader should have working knowledge of the Eclipse 
platform.</p>
<p>The GEF component is separated into three plug-ins:</p>
<ul>
	<li>
	<p>Draw2d (<code>org.eclipse.draw2d</code>) - the lightweight toolkit for 
	painting and layout on an SWT Canvas</li>
	<li>
	<p>GEF (<code>org.eclipse.gef</code>) - an interactive MVC framework built 
	on top of Draw2d</li>
	<li>
	<p>Zest (<code>org.eclipse.zest</code>) - a visualization toolkit built 
	on top of Draw2d</li>
</ul>
<p>Notice that &quot;GEF&quot; can refer to the entire component (2 plug-ins), or just to 
the plug-in <b>org.eclipse.gef</b>.</p>
