				In direct integration, Linux systems are connected directly to Active Directory. The following types of integration are possible:
			</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Integration with the System Security Services Daemon (SSSD)</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
							SSSD can connect a Linux system with various identity and authentication stores: Active Directory, Identity Management, or a generic LDAP or Kerberos server.
						</p><p class="simpara">
							Notable requirements for integration with SSSD:
						</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
									When integrating with Active Directory, SSSD works only within a single AD forest by default. For multi-forest setup, configure manual domain enumeration.
								</li><li class="listitem">
									Remote Active Directory forests must trust the local forest to ensure that the <code class="literal">idmap_ad</code> plug-in handles remote forest users correctly.
								</li></ul></div><p class="simpara">
							SSSD supports both direct and indirect integration. It also enables switching from one integration approach to the other without significant migration costs.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Integration with Samba Winbind</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
							The Winbind component of the Samba suite emulates a Windows client on a Linux system and communicates with Active Directory servers.
						</p><p class="simpara">
							Notable requirements for integration with Samba Winbind:
						</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
									Direct integration with Winbind in a multi-forest Active Directory setup requires bidirectional trusts.
								</li><li class="listitem">
									A bidirectional path from the local domain of a Linux system must exist to the domain of a user in a remote Active Directory forest to allow full information about the user from the remote Active Directory domain to be available to the <code class="literal">idmap_ad</code> plug-in.

				In indirect integration, Linux systems are first connected to a central server which is then connected to Active Directory. Indirect integration enables the administrator to manage Linux systems and policies centrally, while users from Active Directory can transparently access Linux systems and services.
			</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Integration based on cross-forest trust with Active Directory</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
							The Identity Management server acts as the central server to control Linux systems. A cross-realm Kerberos trust with Active Directory is established, enabling users from Active Directory to log on to access Linux systems and resources. Identity Management presents itself to Active Directory as a separate forest and takes advantage of the forest-level trusts supported by Active Directory.
						</p><p class="simpara">
							When using a trust:
						</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
									Active Directory users can access Identity Management resources.
								</li><li class="listitem">
									Identity Management servers and clients can resolve the identities of Active Directory users and groups.
								</li><li class="listitem">
									Active Directory users and groups access Identity Management under the conditions defined by Identity Management, such as host-based access control.
								</li><li class="listitem">
									Active Directory users and groups continue being managed on the Active Directory side.
								</li></ul></div></dd><dt><span class="term">Integration based on synchronization</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
							This approach is based on the WinSync tool. A WinSync replication agreement synchronizes user accounts from Active Directory to Identity Management.
						</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left:0.5in;margin-right:0.5in"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
								WinSync is no longer actively developed in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. The preferred solution for indirect integration is cross-forest trust.
							</p></div><p class="simpara">
							The limitations of integration based on synchronization include:
						</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
									Groups are not synchronized from Identity Management to Active Directory.
								</li><li class="listitem">
									Users are duplicated in Active Directory and Identity Management.
								</li><li class="listitem">
									WinSync supports only a single Active Directory domain.
								</li><li class="listitem">
									Only one domain controller in Active Directory can be used to synchronize data to one instance of Identity Management
								</li><li class="listitem">
									User passwords must be synchronized, which requires the PassSync component to be installed on all domain controllers in the Active Directory domain.
								</li><li class="listitem">
									After configuring the synchronization, all Active Directory users must manually change passwords before PassSync can synchronize them.

				The guidelines in this section can help decide which type of integration fits your use case.

							If you connect less than 30-50 systems, consider direct integration. Indirect integration might introduce unnecessary overhead.
						</dd><dt><span class="term">Connecting more than 30-50 systems (not a hard limit)</span></dt><dd>
							If you connect more than 30-50 systems, consider indirect integration with Identity Management. With this approach, you can benefit from the centralized management for Linux systems.
						</dd><dt><span class="term">Managing a small number of Linux systems, but expecting the number to grow rapidly</span></dt><dd>
							In this scenario, consider indirect integration to avoid having to migrate the environment later.
						</dd></dl></div><h3><a id="frequency_of_deploying_new_systems_and_their_type"></a>Frequency of deploying new systems and their type</h3><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Deploying bare metal systems on an irregular basis</span></dt><dd>
							If you deploy new systems rarely and they are usually bare metal systems, consider direct integration. In such cases, direct integration is usually simplest and easiest.
						</dd><dt><span class="term">Deploying virtual systems frequently</span></dt><dd>
							If you deploy new systems often and they are usually virtual systems provisioned on demand, consider indirect integration. With indirect integration, you can use a central server to manage the new systems dynamically and integrate with orchestration tools, such as Red Hat Satellite.
						</dd></dl></div><h3><a id="active_directory_is_the_required_authentication_provider"></a>Active Directory is the required authentication provider</h3><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Do your internal policies state that all users must authenticate against Active Directory?</span></dt><dd>
							You can choose either direct or indirect integration. If you use indirect integration with a trust between Identity Management and Active Directory, the users that access Linux systems authenticate against Active Directory. Policies that exist in Active Directory are executed and enforced during authentication.
