				This module explains the purpose of Identity Management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux. It also provides basic information about the Identity Management domain, including the client and server machines that are part of the domain.
			</p><div class="title"><strong>The goal of Identity Management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux</strong></div><p>
					Identity Management in Red Hat Enterprise Linux (IdM) provides a centralized and unified way to manage identity stores, authentication, policies, and authorization policies in a Linux-based domain. IdM significantly reduces the administrative overhead of managing different services individually and using different tools on different machines.
				</p><p>
				IdM is one of the few centralized identity, policy, and authorization software solutions that support:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Advanced features of Linux operating system environments
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Unifying large groups of Linux machines
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Native integration with Active Directory
					</li></ul></div><p>
				IdM creates a Linux-based and Linux-controlled domain:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						IdM builds on existing, native Linux tools and protocols. It has its own processes and configuration, but its underlying technologies are well-established on Linux systems and trusted by Linux administrators.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						IdM servers and clients are Red Hat Enterprise Linux machines. IdM clients can also be other Linux and UNIX distributions if they support standard protocols. Windows client cannot be a member of the IdM domain but user logged into Windows systems managed by Active Directory (AD) can connect to Linux clients or access services managed by IdM. This is accomplished by establishing cross forest trust between AD and IdM domains.
					</li></ul></div><div class="title"><strong>Managing identities and policies on multiple Linux servers</strong></div><p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Without IdM:</em></span> Each server is administered separately. All passwords are saved on the local machines. The IT administrator manages users on every machine, sets authentication and authorization policies separately, and maintains local passwords. However, more often the users rely on other centralized solution, for example direct integration with Active Directory (AD). Systems can be directly integrated with AD using several different solutions:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Legacy Linux tools (not recommended to use)
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Solution based on Samba winbind (recommended for specific use cases)
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Solution based on a third-party software (usually require a license from another vendor)
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Solution based on SSSD (native Linux and recommended for the majority of use cases)
					</li></ul></div><p>
				<span class="emphasis"><em>With IdM:</em></span> The IT administrator can:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Maintain the identities in one central place: the IdM server
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Apply policies uniformly to multiples of machines at the same time
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Set different access levels for users by using host-based access control, delegation, and other rules
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Centrally manage privilege escalation rules
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Define how home directories are mounted
					</li></ul></div><div class="title"><strong>Enterprise single sign-on</strong></div><p>
					In case of Identity Management Enterprise, SSO (single sign-on) is implemented leveraging the Kerberos protocol. This protocol is popular in the infrastructure level and enables SSO with services such as SSH, LDAP, NFS, CUPS, or DNS. Web services using different web stacks (Apache, EAP, Django, and others) can also be enabled to use Kerberos for SSO. However, practice shows that using OpenID Connect or SAML based on SSO is more convenient for web applications. To bridge the two layers, it is recommended to deploy an Identity Provider solution (IdP) that would be able to convert Kerberos authentication into a OpenID Connect ticket or SAML assertion. Red Hat SSO technology based on the Keycloak open source project in an example of such IdP

				<span class="emphasis"><em>Without IdM:</em></span> Users log in to the system and are prompted for a password every single time they access a service or application. These passwords might be different, and the users have to remember which credential to use for which application.
			</p><p>
				<span class="emphasis"><em>With Idm:</em></span> After users log in to the system, they can access multiple services and applications without being repeatedly asked for their credentials. This helps to:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Improve usability
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Reduce the security risk of passwords being written down or stored insecurely
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Boost user productivity
					</li></ul></div><div class="title"><strong>Managing a mixed Linux and Windows environment</strong></div><p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>Without IdM:</em></span> Windows systems are managed in an Active Directory forest, but development, production, and other teams have many Linux systems. The Linux systems are excluded from the Active Directory environment.
				</p><p>
				<span class="emphasis"><em>With IdM:</em></span> The IT administrator can:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Manage the Linux systems using native Linux tools
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Integrate the Linux systems into the environments centrally managed by Active Directory, thus preserving a centralized user store.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Easily deploy new Linux systems at scale or as needed.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Quickly react to business needs and make decisions related to management of the Linux infrastructure without dependency on other teams avoiding delays.
					</li></ul></div><div class="title"><strong>Contrasting Identity Management with a Standard LDAP Directory</strong></div><p>
					A standard LDAP directory, such as Red Hat Directory Server, is a general-purpose directory: it can be customized to fit a broad range of use cases.
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Schema: a flexible schema that can be customized for a vast array of entries, such as users, machines, network entities, physical equipment, or buildings.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Typically used as: a back-end directory to store data for other applications, such as business applications that provide services on the Internet.
					</li></ul></div><p>
				Identity Management (IdM) has a specific purpose: managing internal, inside-the-enterprise identities as well as authentication and authorization policies that relate to these identities.
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Schema: a specific schema that defines a particular set of entries relevant to its purpose, such as entries for user or machine identities.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Typically used as: the identity and authentication server to manage identities within the boundaries of an enterprise or a project.
					</li></ul></div><p>
				The underlying directory server technology is the same for both Red Hat Directory Server and IdM. However, IdM is optimized to manage identities inside the enterprise. This limits its general extensibility, but also brings certain benefits: simpler configuration, better automation of resource management, and increased efficiency in managing enterprise identities.

				The Identity Management domain includes the following types of systems:
			</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Identity Management servers</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
							Identity Management servers are Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems that work as domain controllers (DCs). In most deployments, an integrated certificate authority (CA) is also installed with the IdM server.
						</p><p class="simpara">
							Servers are the central repositories for identity and policy information. They also host the services used by domain members.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Identity Management clients</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
							Identity Management clients are Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems enrolled with the servers and configured to use the Identity Management services on these servers.
						</p><p class="simpara">
							Clients interact with the Identity Management servers to access services provided by them. For example, clients use the Kerberos protocol to perform authentication and acquire tickets for enterprise SSO, use LDAP to get identity and policy infromation, use DNS to detect where the servers and services are located and how to connect to them.
						</p><p class="simpara">
							Identity Management servers are also embedded Identity Management clients. As clients enrolled with themselves, the servers provide the same functionality as other clients.
						</p></dd></dl></div><p>
				To provide services for large numbers of clients, as well as for redundancy and availability, Identity Management allows deployment on multiple IdM servers in a single domain. It is possible to deploy up to 60 servers. This is the maximum number of IdM servers, also called replicas, that is currently supported in the IdM domain. Identity Management servers provide different services for the client. Not all the servers need to provide all the possible services. Some server components like Kerberos and LDAP are always available on every server. Other services like Certificate authority (CA), DNS, Trust Controller or Vault are optional. This means that different servers in general play different roles in the deployment.
			</p><p>
				The first server installed to create the domain is the <span class="emphasis"><em>master server</em></span>. If your Identity Management topology contains an integrated Certificate Authority (CA), this server is the <span class="emphasis"><em>CRL generation master</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>CA renewal master</em></span>: the only system in the domain responsible for tracking CA subsystem certificates and keys and for generating the certificate revocation list (CRL).
			</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>
					The CRL generation master role is critical because it is performed by only one server in the topology.
				</p></div><p>
				For redundancy and load balancing, administrators create additional servers by creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>replica</em></span> of any existing server, either the master server or another replica. When creating a replica, Identity Management clones the configuration of the existing server. A replica shares with the initial server its core configuration, including internal information about users, systems, certificates, and configured policies.
			</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
					A replica and the server it was created from are functionally identical except for the role of the CRL generation master. Therefore, the term <span class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>replica</em></span> are used interchangeably here depending on the context.
