			The following sections provide advice on determining the appropriate replica topology for your use case.

				Continuous functionality and high availability of Identity Management services is vital for users who access resources. One of the built-in solutions for accomplishing continuous functionality and high availability of the Identity Management infrastructure through load balancing is the replication of the central directory by creating replica servers of the master server.
			</p><p>
				Identity Management allows placing additional servers in geographically dispersed data centers to reflect your enterprise organizational structure. In this way, the path between Identity Management clients and the nearest accessible server is shortened. In addition, having multiple servers allows spreading the load and scaling for more clients.
			</p><p>
				Maintaining multiple redundant Identity Management servers and letting them replicate with each other is also a common backup mechanism to mitigate or prevent server loss. For example, if one server fails, the other servers keep providing services to the domain. You can also recover the lost server by creating a new replica based on one of the remaining servers.

				The Identity Management domain includes the following types of systems:
			</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Identity Management servers</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
							Identity Management servers are Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems that work as domain controllers (DCs). In most deployments, an integrated certificate authority (CA) is also installed with the IdM server.
						</p><p class="simpara">
							Servers are the central repositories for identity and policy information. They also host the services used by domain members.
						</p><p class="simpara">
							Identity Management servers are also embedded Identity Management clients. As clients enrolled with themselves, the servers provide the same functionality as other clients.
						</p></dd><dt><span class="term">Identity Management clients</span></dt><dd><p class="simpara">
							Identity Management clients are Red Hat Enterprise Linux systems enrolled with the servers and configured to use the Identity Management services on these servers.
						</p><p class="simpara">
							Clients interact with the Identity Management servers to access domain resources. For example, clients belong to the Kerberos domain configured on the servers, receive certificates and tickets issued by the servers, and use other centralized services for authentication and authorization.
						</p></dd></dl></div><p>
				The first server installed to create the domain is the <span class="emphasis"><em>master server</em></span>. If your Identity Management topology contains an integrated Certificate Authority (CA), this server is the <span class="emphasis"><em>CRL generation master</em></span> and the <span class="emphasis"><em>CA_renewal_master</em></span>: the only system in the domain responsible for tracking CA subsystem certificates and keys and for generating the certificate revocation list (CRL).
			</p><div class="important" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Important</h3><p>
					The CRL generation master role is critical because it is performed by only one server in the topology.
				</p></div><p>
				For redundancy and load balancing, administrators create additional servers by creating a <span class="emphasis"><em>replica</em></span> of any existing server, either the master server or another replica. When creating a replica, Identity Management clones the configuration of the existing server. A replica shares with the initial server its core configuration, including internal information about users, systems, certificates, and configured policies.
			</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
					A replica and the server it was created from are functionally identical except for the role of the CRL generation master. Therefore, the term <span class="emphasis"><em>server</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>replica</em></span> are used interchangeably here depending on the context.
				</p></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="introduction-to-replication-agreements_planning-the-replica-topology"/>Replication agreements</h1></div></div></div><p>
				When an administrator creates a replica based on an existing server, Identity Management creates a <span class="emphasis"><em>replication agreement</em></span> between the initial server and the replica. The replication agreement ensures that the data and configuration is continuously replicated between the two servers.
			</p><p>
				Replication agreements are always bilateral: the data is replicated from one server to the other as well as from the other server to the first server.
			</p><p>
				Identity Management uses <span class="emphasis"><em>multi-master replication</em></span>. In multi-master replication, all replicas joined in a replication agreement receive updates, and are therefore considered data masters.
			</p><div class="figure"><a id="planning-the-replica-topology-fig-replica1-replica-fin"/><p class="title"><strong>Figure 2.1. Server and replica agreements</strong></p><div class="figure-contents"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/ipa-replica.png" alt="ipa replica"/></div></div></div><p>
				Identity Management uses two types of replication agreements:
			</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term">Domain replication agreements</span></dt><dd>
							These agreements replicate the identity information.
						</dd><dt><span class="term">Certificate replication agreements</span></dt><dd>
							These agreements replicate the certificate information.
						</dd></dl></div><p>
				Both replication channels are independent. Two servers can have one or both types of replication agreements configured between them. For example, when server A and server B have only domain replication agreement configured, only identity information is replicated between them, not the certificate information.
