					QEMU occasionally splits an 8-byte <code class="literal">ggtt</code> entry write to two consecutive 4-byte writes. Each of these partial writes can trigger a separate host <code class="literal">ggtt</code> write. Sometimes the two <code class="literal">ggtt</code> writes are combined incorrectly. Consequently, translation to a machine address fails, and an error log occurs.

					Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8.0 only supports the <code class="literal">opensc</code> library for smart cards. With this update, the Enterprise Security Client (ESC) use <code class="literal">opensc</code> for token detection instead of the removed <code class="literal">coolkey</code> library. As a result, applications correctly detect supported tokens.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1565073"/></p><div class="title"><strong>Certificate System now supports rotating debug logs</strong></div><p>
					Previously, Certificate System used a custom logging framework, which did not support log rotation. As a consequence, debug logs such as <code class="literal">/var/log/pki/<span class="emphasis"><em>instance_name</em></span>/ca/debug</code> grew indefinitely. With this update, Certificate System uses the <code class="literal">java.logging.util</code> framework, which supports log rotation. As a result, you can configure log rotation in the <code class="literal">/var/lib/pki/<span class="emphasis"><em>instance_name</em></span>/conf/logging.properties</code> file.
				</p><p>
				For further information on log rotation, see documentation for the <code class="literal">java.util.logging</code> package.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1424966"/></p><div class="title"><strong>Certificate System no longer logs <code class="literal">SetAllPropertiesRule</code> operation warnings when the service starts</strong></div><p>
					Previously, Certificate System logged warnings on the <code class="literal">SetAllPropertiesRule</code> operation in the <code class="literal">/var/log/messages</code> log file when the service started. The problem has been fixed, and the mentioned warnings are no longer logged.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1623444"/></p><div class="title"><strong>The Certificate System KRA client parses <code class="literal">Key Request</code> responses correctly</strong></div><p>
					Previously, Certificate System switched to a new JSON library. As a consequence, serialization for certain objects differed, and the Python key recovery authority (KRA) client failed to parse <code class="literal">Key Request</code> responses. The client has been modified to support responses using both the old and the new JSON library. As a result, the Python KRA client parses <code class="literal">Key Request</code> responses correctly.

					Previously, when compiling with the <code class="literal">-O3</code> optimization level option, the GNU Compiler Collection (GCC) occasionally returned a false positive warning about an out-of-bounds access, even if the compiled code did not contain it. The optimization has been fixed and GCC no longer displays the false positive warning.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1584322"/></p><div class="title"><strong><code class="literal">ltrace</code> displays large structures correctly</strong></div><p>
					Previously, the <code class="literal">ltrace</code> tool could not correctly print large structures returned from functions. Handling of large structures in <code class="literal">ltrace</code> has been improved and they are now printed correctly.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1652016"/></p><div class="title"><strong>GCC built-in function <code class="literal">__builtin_clz</code> returns correct values on IBM Z</strong></div><p>
					Previously, the <code class="literal">FLOGR</code> instruction of the IBM Z architecture was incorrectly folded by the GCC compiler. As a consequence, the <code class="literal">__builtin_clz</code> function using this instruction could return wrong results when the code was compiled with the <code class="literal">-funroll-loops</code> GCC option. This bug has been fixed and the function now provides correct results.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1491128"/></p><div class="title"><strong>GDB provides nonzero exit status when last command in batch mode fails</strong></div><p>
					Previously, GDB always exited with status <code class="literal">0</code> when running in batch mode, regardless of errors in the commands. As a consequence, it was not possible to determine whether the commands succeeded. This behavior has been changed and GDB now exits with status <code class="literal">1</code> when an error occurs in the last command. This preserves compatibility with the previous behavior where all commands are executed. As a result, it is now possible to determine if GDB batch mode execution is successful.

					Previously, the <code class="literal">iscsiadm</code> utility terminated unexpectedly when the user specified a print level higher than 0 with the <code class="literal">--print</code> or <code class="literal">-P</code> option. This problem has been fixed, and all print levels now work as expected.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1673167"/></p><div class="title"><strong><code class="literal">multipathd</code> no longer disables the path when it fails to get the WWID of a path</strong></div><p>
					Previously, the <code class="literal">multipathd</code> service treated a failed attempt at getting a path’s WWID as getting an empty WWID. If <code class="literal">multipathd</code> failed to get the WWID of a path, it sometimes disabled that path.
				</p><p>
				With this update, <code class="literal">multipathd</code> continues to use the old WWID if it fails to get the WWID when checking to see if it has changed.
			</p><p>
				As a result, <code class="literal">multipathd</code> no longer disables paths when it fails to get the WWID, when checking if the WWID has changed.

					When TLS renegotiation is enabled on the server, a client is allowed to send a renegotiation request, which initiates a new handshake. Computational requirements of a handshake are higher on a server than on a client. This makes the server vulnerable to DoS attacks. With this fix, the setting <code class="literal">PCSD_SSL_OPTIONS</code> in the <code class="literal">/etc/sysconfig/pcsd</code> configuration file accepts the <code class="literal">OP_NO_RENEGOTIATION</code> option to reject renegotiations. Note that the client can still open multiple connections to a server with a handshake performed in all of them.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1595829"/></p><div class="title"><strong>A removed cluster node is no longer displayed in the cluster status</strong></div><p>
					Previously, when a node was removed with the <code class="literal">pcs cluster node remove</code> command, the removed node remained visible in the output of a <code class="literal">pcs status</code> display. With this fix, the removed node is no longer displayed in the cluster status.
				</p><p>
				(BZ#1595829)
			</p><p><a id="BZ-1436217"/></p><div class="title"><strong>Fence agents can now be configured using either newer, preferred parameter names or deprecated parameter names</strong></div><p>
					A large number of fence agent parameters have been renamed while the old parameter names are still supported as deprecated. Previously, <code class="literal">pcs</code> was not able to set the new parameters unless used with the <code class="literal">--force</code> option. With this fix, <code class="literal">pcs</code> now supports the renamed fence agent parameters while maintaining support for the deprecated parameters.
				</p><p>
				(BZ#1436217)
			</p><p><a id="BZ-1578955"/></p><div class="title"><strong>The <code class="literal">pcs</code> command now correctly reads the XML status of a cluster for display</strong></div><p>
					The <code class="literal">pcs</code> command runs the <code class="literal">crm_mon</code> utility to get the status of a cluster in XML format. The <code class="literal">crm_mon</code> utility prints XML to standard output and warnings to standard error output. Previously <code class="literal">pcs</code> mixed XML and warnings into one stream and was then unable to parse it as XML. With this fix, standard and error outputs are separated in <code class="literal">pcs</code> and reading the XML status of a cluster works as expected.
				</p><p>
				(BZ#1578955)
			</p><p><a id="BZ-1596050"/></p><div class="title"><strong>Users no longer advised to destroy clusters when creating new clusters with nodes from existing clusters</strong></div><p>
					Previously, when a user specified nodes from an existing cluster when running the <code class="literal">pcs cluster setup</code> command or when creating a cluster with the <code class="literal">pcsd</code> Web UI, pcs reported that as an error and suggested that the user destroy the cluster on the nodes. As a result, users would destroy the cluster on the nodes, breaking the cluster the nodes were part of as the remaining nodes would still consider the destroyed nodes to be part of the cluster. With this fix, users are instead advised to remove nodes from their cluster, better informing them of how to address the issue without breaking their clusters.

				(BZ#1596050)
			</p><p><a id="BZ-1554310"/></p><div class="title"><strong><code class="literal">pcs</code> commands no longer interactively ask for credentials</strong></div><p>
					When a non-root user runs a <code class="literal">pcs</code> command that requires root permission, <code class="literal">pcs</code> connects to the locally running <code class="literal">pcsd</code> daemon and passes the command to it, since the <code class="literal">pcsd</code> daemon runs with root permissions and is capable of running the command. Previously, if the user was not authenticated to the local <code class="literal">pcsd</code> daemon, <code class="literal">pcs</code> asked for a user name and a password interactively. This was confusing to the user and required special handling in scripts running <code class="literal">pcs</code>. With this fix, if the user is not authenticated then <code class="literal">pcs</code> exits with an error advising what to do: Either run <code class="literal">pcs</code> as root or authenticate using the new <code class="literal">pcs client local-auth</code> command. As a result, <code class="literal">pcs</code> commands do not interactively ask for credentials, improving the user experience.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1638852"/></p><div class="title"><strong>The <code class="literal">pcsd</code> daemon now starts with its default self-generated SSL certificate when <code class="literal">crypto-policies</code> is set to <code class="literal">FUTURE</code>.</strong></div><p>
					A <code class="literal">crypto-policies</code> setting of <code class="literal">FUTURE</code> requires RSA keys in SSL certificates to be at least 3072b long. Previously, the <code class="literal">pcsd</code> daemon would not start when this policy was set since it generates SSL certificates with a 2048b key. With this update, the key size of <code class="literal">pcsd</code> self-generated SSL certificates has been increased to 3072b and <code class="literal">pcsd</code> now starts with its default self-generated SSL certificate.

			</p><p><a id="BZ-1640477"/></p><div class="title"><strong>The <code class="literal">pcsd</code> service now starts when the network is ready</strong></div><p>
					Previously, When a user configured <code class="literal">pcsd</code> to bind to a specific IP address and the address was not ready during boot when <code class="literal">pcsd</code> attempted to start up, then <code class="literal">pcsd</code> failed to start and a manual intervention was required to start <code class="literal">pcsd</code>. With this fix, <code class="literal">pcsd.service</code> depends on <code class="literal">network-online.target</code>. As a result, <code class="literal">pcsd</code> starts when the network is ready and is able to bind to an IP address.

					Previously, the <code class="literal">glib-networking</code> package was not compatible with RHEL 8 System-wide Crypto Policy. As a consequence, applications using the <code class="literal">glib</code> library for networking might allow Transport Layer Security (TLS) connections using weak algorithms than the administrator intended. With this update, the system-wide crypto policy is applied, and now applications using <code class="literal">glib</code> for networking allow only TLS connections that are acceptable according to the policy.

					Previously, SELinux policy was too restrictive for <code class="literal">iscsiuio</code> processes and these processes were not able to access <code class="literal">/dev/uio*</code> devices using the <code class="literal">mmap</code> system call. As a consequence, connection to the discovery portal failed. This update adds the missing rules to the SELinux policy and <code class="literal">iscsiuio</code> processes work as expected in the described scenario.

					Previously, the <code class="literal">dnf</code> or <code class="literal">yum</code> commands ignored the <code class="literal">https://</code> prefix from a URL added by the <span class="strong"><strong>subscription-manager</strong></span> service. The updated <code class="literal">dnf</code> or <code class="literal">yum</code> commands do not ignore invalid <code class="literal">https://</code> URLs. As a consequence, <code class="literal">dnf</code> and <code class="literal">yum</code> failed to access the repos. To fix the problem, a new configuration variable, <code class="literal">proxy_scheme</code> has been added to the <code class="literal">/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf</code> file and the value can be set to either <code class="literal">http</code> or <code class="literal">https</code>. If no value is specified, <span class="strong"><strong>subscription-manager</strong></span> set <code class="literal">http</code> by default which is more commonly used.
				</p><p>
				Note that if the proxy uses <code class="literal">http</code>, most users should not change anything in the configuration in <code class="literal">/etc/rhsm/rhsm.conf</code>. If the proxy uses <code class="literal">https</code>, users should update the value of <code class="literal">proxy_scheme</code> to <code class="literal">https</code>. Then, in both cases, users need to run the <code class="literal">subscription-manager repos --list</code> command or wait for the <code class="literal">rhsmcertd</code> daemon process to regenerate the <code class="literal">/etc/yum.repos.d/redhat.repo</code> properly.
