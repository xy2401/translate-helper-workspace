				Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) provides an additional layer of system security. SELinux fundamentally answers the question: <span class="emphasis"><em>May &lt;subject&gt; do &lt;action&gt; to &lt;object&gt;?</em></span>, for example: <span class="emphasis"><em>May a web server access files in users' home directories?</em></span>
			</p><p>
				The standard access policy based on the user, group, and other permissions, known as Discretionary Access Control (DAC), does not enable system administrators to create comprehensive and fine-grained security policies, such as restricting specific applications to only viewing log files, while allowing other applications to append new data to the log files.
			</p><p>
				SELinux implements Mandatory Access Control (MAC). Every process and system resource has a special security label called an <span class="emphasis"><em>SELinux context</em></span>. A SELinux context, sometimes referred to as an <span class="emphasis"><em>SELinux label</em></span>, is an identifier which abstracts away the system-level details and focuses on the security properties of the entity. Not only does this provide a consistent way of referencing objects in the SELinux policy, but it also removes any ambiguity that can be found in other identification methods. For example, a file can have multiple valid path names on a system that makes use of bind mounts.
			</p><p>
				The SELinux policy uses these contexts in a series of rules which define how processes can interact with each other and the various system resources. By default, the policy does not allow any interaction unless a rule explicitly grants access.
			</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
					Remember that SELinux policy rules are checked after DAC rules. SELinux policy rules are not used if DAC rules deny access first, which means that no SELinux denial is logged if the traditional DAC rules prevent the access.
				</p></div><p>
				SELinux contexts have several fields: user, role, type, and security level. The SELinux type information is perhaps the most important when it comes to the SELinux policy, as the most common policy rule which defines the allowed interactions between processes and system resources uses SELinux types and not the full SELinux context. SELinux types end with <code class="literal">_t</code>. For example, the type name for the web server is <code class="literal">httpd_t</code>. The type context for files and directories normally found in <code class="literal">/var/www/html/</code> is <code class="literal">httpd_sys_content_t</code>. The type contexts for files and directories normally found in <code class="literal">/tmp</code> and <code class="literal">/var/tmp/</code> is <code class="literal">tmp_t</code>. The type context for web server ports is <code class="literal">http_port_t</code>.
			</p><p>
				There is a policy rule that permits Apache (the web server process running as <code class="literal">httpd_t</code>) to access files and directories with a context normally found in <code class="literal">/var/www/html/</code> and other web server directories (<code class="literal">httpd_sys_content_t</code>). There is no allow rule in the policy for files normally found in <code class="literal">/tmp</code> and <code class="literal">/var/tmp/</code>, so access is not permitted. With SELinux, even if Apache is compromised, and a malicious script gains access, it is still not able to access the <code class="literal">/tmp</code> directory.

				As the previous scheme shows, SELinux allows the Apache process running as <code class="literal">httpd_t</code> to access the <code class="literal">/var/www/html/</code> directory and it denies the same process to access the <code class="literal">/data/mysql/</code> directory because there is no allow rule for the <code class="literal">httpd_t</code> and <code class="literal">mysqld_db_t</code> type contexts). On the other hand, the MariaDB process running as <code class="literal">mysqld_t</code> is able to access the <code class="literal">/data/mysql/</code> directory and SELinux also correctly denies the process with the <code class="literal">mysqld_t</code> type to access the <code class="literal">/var/www/html/</code> directory labeled as <code class="literal">httpd_sys_content_t</code>.

				SELinux provides the following benefits:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						All processes and files are labeled. SELinux policy rules define how processes interact with files, as well as how processes interact with each other. Access is only allowed if an SELinux policy rule exists that specifically allows it.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Fine-grained access control. Stepping beyond traditional UNIX permissions that are controlled at user discretion and based on Linux user and group IDs, SELinux access decisions are based on all available information, such as an SELinux user, role, type, and, optionally, a security level.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						SELinux policy is administratively-defined and enforced system-wide.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Improved mitigation for privilege escalation attacks. Processes run in domains, and are therefore separated from each other. SELinux policy rules define how processes access files and other processes. If a process is compromised, the attacker only has access to the normal functions of that process, and to files the process has been configured to have access to. For example, if the Apache HTTP Server is compromised, an attacker cannot use that process to read files in user home directories, unless a specific SELinux policy rule was added or configured to allow such access.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						SELinux can be used to enforce data confidentiality and integrity, as well as protecting processes from untrusted inputs.
					</li></ul></div><p>
				However, SELinux is not:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						antivirus software,
					</li><li class="listitem">
						replacement for passwords, firewalls, and other security systems,
					</li><li class="listitem">
						all-in-one security solution.
					</li></ul></div><p>
				SELinux is designed to enhance existing security solutions, not replace them. Even when running SELinux, it is important to continue to follow good security practices, such as keeping software up-to-date, using hard-to-guess passwords, and firewalls.
			</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="selinux-examples_getting-started-with-selinux"/>SELinux examples</h1></div></div></div><p>
				The following examples demonstrate how SELinux increases security:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						The default action is deny. If an SELinux policy rule does not exist to allow access, such as for a process opening a file, access is denied.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						SELinux can confine Linux users. A number of confined SELinux users exist in the SELinux policy. Linux users can be mapped to confined SELinux users to take advantage of the security rules and mechanisms applied to them. For example, mapping a Linux user to the SELinux <code class="literal">user_u</code> user, results in a Linux user that is not able to run unless configured otherwise set user ID (setuid) applications, such as <code class="literal">sudo</code> and <code class="literal">su</code>, as well as preventing them from executing potentially malicious files and applications in their home directory.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Increased process and data separation. The concept of SELinux <span class="emphasis"><em>domains</em></span> allows defining which processes can access certain files and directories. For example, when running SELinux, unless otherwise configured, an attacker cannot compromise a Samba server, and then use that Samba server as an attack vector to read and write to files used by other processes, such as MariaDB databases.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						SELinux helps mitigate the damage made by configuration mistakes. Domain Name System (DNS) servers often replicate information between each other in what is known as a zone transfer. Attackers can use zone transfers to update DNS servers with false information. When running the Berkeley Internet Name Domain (BIND) as a DNS server in Red Hat Enterprise Linux, even if an administrator forgets to limit which servers can perform a zone transfer, the default SELinux policy prevents zone files <a href="#ftn.idm140064316617104" class="footnote" id="idm140064316617104"><sup class="footnote">[1]</sup></a> from being updated using zone transfers, by the BIND <code class="literal">named</code> daemon itself, and by other processes.

				SELinux is a Linux Security Module (LSM) that is built into the Linux kernel. The SELinux subsystem in the kernel is driven by a security policy which is controlled by the administrator and loaded at boot. All security-relevant, kernel-level access operations on the system are intercepted by SELinux and examined in the context of the loaded security policy. If the loaded policy allows the operation, it continues. Otherwise, the operation is blocked and the process receives an error.
			</p><p>
				SELinux decisions, such as allowing or disallowing access, are cached. This cache is known as the Access Vector Cache (AVC). When using these cached decisions, SELinux policy rules need to be checked less, which increases performance. Remember that SELinux policy rules have no effect if DAC rules deny access first. Raw audit messages are logged to the <code class="literal">/var/log/audit/audit.log</code> and they start with the <code class="literal">type=AVC</code> string.
			</p><p>
				In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, system services are controlled by the <code class="literal">systemd</code> daemon; <code class="literal">systemd</code> starts and stops all services, and users and processes communicate with <code class="literal">systemd</code> using the <code class="literal">systemctl</code> utility. The <code class="literal">systemd</code> daemon can consult the SELinux policy and check the label of the calling process and the label of the unit file that the caller tries to manage, and then ask SELinux whether or not the caller is allowed the access. This approach strengthens access control to critical system capabilities, which include starting and stopping system services.
			</p><p>
				The <code class="literal">systemd</code> daemon also works as an SELinux Access Manager. It retrieves the label of the process running <code class="literal">systemctl</code> or the process that sent a <code class="literal">D-Bus</code> message to <code class="literal">systemd</code>. The daemon then looks up the label of the unit file that the process wanted to configure. Finally, <code class="literal">systemd</code> can retrieve information from the kernel if the SELinux policy allows the specific access between the process label and the unit file label. This means a compromised application that needs to interact with <code class="literal">systemd</code> for a specific service can now be confined by SELinux. Policy writers can also use these fine-grained controls to confine administrators.

					To avoid incorrect SELinux labeling and subsequent problems, ensure that you start services using a <code class="literal">systemctl start</code> command.

				Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 provides the following packages for working with SELinux:

				SELinux can run in one of three modes: enforcing, permissive, or disabled.
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Enforcing mode is the default, and recommended, mode of operation; in enforcing mode SELinux operates normally, enforcing the loaded security policy on the entire system.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						In permissive mode, the system acts as if SELinux is enforcing the loaded security policy, including labeling objects and emitting access denial entries in the logs, but it does not actually deny any operations. While not recommended for production systems, permissive mode can be helpful for SELinux policy development and debugging.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Disabled mode is strongly discouraged; not only does the system avoid enforcing the SELinux policy, it also avoids labeling any persistent objects such as files, making it difficult to enable SELinux in the future.
					</li></ul></div><p>
				Use the <code class="literal">setenforce</code> utility to change between enforcing and permissive mode. Changes made with <code class="literal">setenforce</code> do not persist across reboots. To change to enforcing mode, enter the <code class="literal">setenforce 1</code> command as the Linux root user. To change to permissive mode, enter the <code class="literal">setenforce 0</code> command. Use the <code class="literal">getenforce</code> utility to view the current SELinux mode:
			</p><pre class="screen"># getenforce
Enforcing</pre><pre class="screen"># setenforce 0
# getenforce
Permissive</pre><pre class="screen"># setenforce 1
# getenforce
Enforcing</pre><p>
				In Red Hat Enterprise Linux, you can set individual domains to permissive mode while the system runs in enforcing mode. For example, to make the <span class="emphasis"><em>httpd_t</em></span> domain permissive:
			</p><pre class="screen"># semanage permissive -a <span class="emphasis"><em>httpd_t</em></span></pre><p>
				Note that permissive domains are a powerful tool that can compromise security of your system. Red Hat recommends to use permissive domains with caution, for example, when debugging a specific scenario.
