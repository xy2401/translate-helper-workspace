It gives us a unique insight into            how a program runs and allows us to gain a much deeper understanding of the piece of code we debug. It            allows us to trace running code and inspect the state and the flow of the execution. As part of that, it            gives us the illusion of a sequential flow. This is very intuitive and powerful but also may be            misleading as most modern applications are multithreaded.        </p>        <p id="09b6bfc1">"Debugging" suggests we deal with bugs but this is actually a misnomer. The information we get from debugging            is useful even when there is no problem with the code. Finding bugs just happens to be a very common use            case for the knowledge we can get from a debug session.        </p>        <p id="652698d1">The IntelliJ IDEA debugger offers a rich experience that helps us to easily debug anything from the simplest            code to complex multithreaded applications.        </p>        <p id="b1e933dc">Before we start, a word of caution: debugging is a very powerful tool but it does come with a cost. The debug process is part            of the runtime and therefore affects it.            Every evaluation of an expression happens using the same memory of            the debugged application, and can modify and potentially corrupt the state.            During this tutorial, bear in mind that debugging is an intrusive approach that may affect the outcome of            the debugged application. We will explore a few ways to minimize its impact and sometimes even exploit it.            The timing of execution is also very different when you debug code compared to running it.            The minimal debug tracking overhead in itself may already be enough to change the timing of events and therefore the application behaviour. Every            <a href="using-breakpoints.html">breakpoint</a>            or log is a possible synchronization point, and stepping obviously changes the timings significantly.            As we are about to see, this becomes a critical issue in multithreaded environments, when sometimes reproducing a bug            depends on a very specific sequence of events.        </p>        <p id="d3babf30">Last point to remember is that debugging is not a substitute for understanding the code. In fact, the            only way to learn from a debug session is to constantly compare the information the debugger shows us with            our expectations from the code and how we think it "should" behave.            Before starting a debugging session we must have some knowledge of what we're trying to achieve by it.            If we're looking for a bug, we need to roughly know what is incorrect, i.e. what is different from the            expected behaviour or state. In most cases we will also have some initial assumption as to why things are            wrong. This will dictate how our debugging session should be conducted. When we debug,            we must always compare that information with our expectations, and pay close attention when the code deviates from these expectations.            <br>This is the point where debugging is so effective.            <br>This is the point where we learn.        </p>        <p id="6c2eb0d4">            In this tutorial we try to dive deeper into debugging techniques and assume you are already familiar with the            basic concepts such as:            <ul class="list _bullet"><li class="list__item" id="41085502"><p><a href="using-breakpoints.html#set-line-breakpoint">Line breakpoints</a> to suspend the JVM or thread.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="501e1e25"><p><a href="stepping-through-the-program.html">Stepping</a>.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="ac8f7a79"><p><a href="settings-debugger-stepping.html">Classes configured to be skipped</a>.</p></li><li class="list__item" id="ad17d89e"><p><a href="stepping-through-the-program.html#force_step_into">Force to step into</a>  "skipped code".</p></li><li class="list__item" id="6c18e436"><a href="evaluating-expressions.html"><span>Evaluating Expressions</span></a></li><li class="list__item" id="2723bd6b"><p>Using a <a href="adding-editing-and-removing-watches.html">watch</a></p></li><li class="list__item" id="53d805dc"><p>Defining a <a href="debugger-data-type-renderers.html">type renderer</a></p></li></ul>        </p>    </div>    <div class="chapter"><h2 id="a5302e0c" data-toc="Tutorial_Java_Debugging_Deep_Dive#a5302e0c">Debugging code that was compiled without the debug flag</h2>        <p id="da36d210">Code that was compiled without the debug flag cannot be debugged.

This is a real issue because the scenario of an event handler processing millions of            events is fairly common (think of replaying a journal file or processing huge production log files)            and evaluating a breakpoint condition inside that event handling code can            slow down the system to an unusable state. To overcome that, assuming we can modify running            code, we can improve the speed by employing a little trick we shall call "breakpoint in code".            This trick is very useful when we debug processing of millions of events where only one causes a            problem and we have no idea in advance which is the problematic one, and can save us a lot of waiting            for a conditional breakpoint to be triggered.            The fastest code is the executed code that was compiled and optimized by the JVM. We want to use            that fact and so, instead of writing a condition on a breakpoint, we introduce it to our executed            code in a way that we can manipulate later. We then debug without any breakpoint, thus running in            the fastest way a debugging session can run, and introduce a breakpoint while the code is running            only when we actually know we will hit it.        </p>        <section class="procedure-steps"><h2 id="4e4de1a1">Breakpoint in code</h2><ol class="list _decimal"><li class="list__item" id="1a417d6b">We introduce a loop to the code with our condition.

Once we gain some information or have an assumption on            what the execution order is that will cause the bug, we can also use the debug features to reproduce it using a            <a href="tutorial-java-debugging-deep-dive.html#dependency_on_other_breakpoint">dependency between breakpoints</a>.        </p>        <div class="chapter"><h3 id="b6f37572" data-toc="Tutorial_Java_Debugging_Deep_Dive#b6f37572">Detecting race condition resulting in a corrupted state</h3>            <aside class="tip sideblock" data-title="" rel="b6f37572" id="e1368eb8">                <p id="5bb1a15e">If you suspect a race condition, start by debugging without any breakpoints just to make sure you can                    still reproduce the issue in the debug mode.                </p>            </aside>            <p id="c4deb115">                Sometimes race conditions only occur once in every ten or a hundred runs of the system.

For example, here we've                created a system of publishers and subscribers, however all our subscribers share a primitive (and                not a thread-safe) counter to count the total number of consumed messages.            </p>            <div class="code-block" data-lang="Java"><code class="code-block__wrapper"><span class="kd">private</span> <span class="kd">class</span> <span class="nc">Subscriber</span> <span class="kd">implements</span> <span class="n">Runnable</span>

This also flushes the CPU caches of all threads, as writing to                the log is atomic. In short, it prevents us from reproducing the bug. Suspending either the VM or                the thread cannot help us here either, as we can't separate the two instructions (reading the counter                value and incrementing it) to break between them. At this point, we need to make some assumptions then                prove or refute them.
