<h1 class="topictitle1">Managing user actions (user options)</h1>

<div class="p">To create a new action or change an existing action:</div>
<ol>
<li><span>In the Remote Systems view, expand the connection
containing the kinds of resources you want to act on,
navigate to the subsystem that would contain those resources, and
select <b>Work with &gt; User actions</b>.
You can also right-click on a file in one of your filters, and select <b>User
Actions</b>.</span></li>
<li><span>Type the text to display in the <b>Action Name</b> field.
This is a brief label for the action.</span></li>
<li><span>Type a longer, more descriptive text for the action in the <b>Comment</b>
field.</span></li>
<li><span>Type the actual command string to run when
a user selects this action. This command can use action substitution
variables when your action is run. These variables are used when defining the
command string to run for a particular action. Substitution variables keep you
from having to explicitly code command parameter values. Click <b>Insert
variable</b> to see and select valid variables.</span></li>
</ol>
<div class="p"><b>Additional parameters</b>
<ul>
<li>Select <b>Browse</b> to search for and select command
files (for example, .exe, .bat or .cmd files). The file name you select
is reflected in the Command field when you return. </li>
<li>Select <b>Prompt</b> to prompt the command currently entered
in the Command area.</li>
<li>Select <b>Prompt first</b> to indicate that Remote System
Explorer should prompt the command when it is run.</li>
<li>Select <b>Refresh after</b> to have Remote System Explorer
refresh the selected files after the action's command is run. This is
useful if your command affects the information displayed in the file list
window for the selected files, for example, if your command changes the type
of a file.</li>
<li>Select <b>Show action</b>.</li>
<li>Select <b>Single selection only</b> if you want to show
this action only when a single object is selected.</li>
<li>Select <b>Invoke once </b> to collect the full names of
all selected resources into the file name parameter and run the command
only once for all resources that are selected..</li>
<li>Select any currently defined named types from the <b>Defined
Types</b> list
and click <b>Add</b> to include them in the <b>Selected
Types</b> list. The action will only appear if a file matching one
of these types is selected.</li>
</ul>
<p>You can choose to view user actions by active profile for remote
objects
on the <b>User Actions</b> cascade menu. You can see both
team-shared and private user actions. To enable this, select <b>Cascade
user actions by profile</b> on the <b>Remote Systems Preferences</b>
page.</p>
