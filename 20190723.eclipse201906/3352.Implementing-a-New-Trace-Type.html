		<h1 id="Implementing_a_New_Trace_Type">Implementing a New Trace Type</h1>
		<p>The framework can easily be extended to support more trace types. To make a new
			trace type, one must define the following items:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>The event type</li>
			<li>The trace type</li>
			<li>The trace context</li>
			<li>The trace location</li>
			<li>The 
				<i>org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tracetype</i> plug-in extension point
			</li>
			<li>(Optional) The 
				<i>org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetypeui</i> plug-in extension point
			</li>
		</ul>
		<p>The 
			<b>event type</b> must implement an 
			<i>ITmfEvent</i> or extend a class that
			implements an 
			<i>ITmfEvent</i>. Typically it will extend 
			<i>TmfEvent</i>. The event
			type must contain all the data of an event.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>trace type</b> must be of an 
			<i>ITmfTrace</i> type. The 
			<i>TmfTrace</i> class
			will supply many background operations so that the reader only needs to
			implement certain functions. This includes the 
			<i>event aspects</i> for events of
			this trace type. See the section below.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>trace context</b> can be seen as the internals of an iterator. It is
			required by the trace reader to parse events as it iterates the trace and to
			keep track of its rank and location. It can have a timestamp, a rank, a file
			position, or any other element, it should be considered to be ephemeral.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>trace location</b> is an element that is cloned often to store
			checkpoints, it is generally persistent. It is used to rebuild a context,
			therefore, it needs to contain enough information to unambiguously point to one
			and only one event. Finally the 
			<i>tracetype</i> plug-in extension associates a
			given trace, non-programmatically to a trace type for use in the UI.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Event_Aspects">Event Aspects</h2>
		<p>In Trace Compass, an 
			<i>event aspect</i> represents any type of information that
			can be extracted from a trace event. The simple case is information that is
			present directly in the event. For example, the timestamp of an event, a field
			of an LTTng event, or the "payload" that is on the same line of a text trace
			entry. But it could also be the result of an indirect operation, for example a
			state system query at the timestamp of the given event (see the section

			<a href="Generic-State-System.html#Generic_State_System">Generic State System</a>).
		</p>
		<p>All aspects should implement the 
			<b>ITmfEventAspect</b> interface. The important
			method in there is 
			<i>resolve(ITmfEvent)</i>, which tells this aspect what to
			output for a given event. The singleton pattern fits well for pre-defined aspect
			classes, in general.
		</p>
		<p>The aspects defined for a trace type determine the initial columns in the Event
			Table, as well as the elements on which the trace can be filtered, among other
			things.</p>
		<h3 id="Base_and_custom_aspects">Base and custom aspects</h3>
		<p>Some base aspects are defined in 
			<b>TmfTrace#BASE_ASPECTS</b>. They use generic
			methods found in 
			<b>ITmfEvent</b>, so they should be applicable for any event
			type defined in the framework. If one does not override

			<b>TmfTrace#getEventAspects</b>, then only the base aspects will be used with
			this trace.
		</p>
		<p>Overriding the method does not append to this list, it replaces it. So if you
			wish to define additional aspects for a new trace type, do not forget to include
			the BASE_ASPECTS you want to use, if any, within the list.</p>
		<p>The order of the elements in the returned 
			<i>Iterable</i> may matter to other
			components. For instance, the initial ordering of the columns in the Events
			Table will match it.
		</p>
		<p>Defining additional aspects allows to expose more data from the trace events
			without having to update all the views using the aspects API.</p>
		<h3 id="Creating_event_aspects_programmatically">Creating event aspects programmatically</h3>
		<p>Another advantage of event aspects is that they can be created programmatically,
			without having to modify the base trace or event classes. A new analysis
			applying to a pre-existing trace type may wish to define additional aspects to
			make its job easier.</p>
		<p>While the notion of event aspects should not be exposed to users directly, it is
			possible to create new aspects based on user input. For example, an "event
			field" dialog could ask the user to enter a field name, which would then create
			an aspect that would look for the value of a field with this name in every
			event. The user could then be able to display or filter on this aspect.</p>
		<h2 id="Optional_Trace_Type_Attributes">Optional Trace Type Attributes</h2>
		<p>After defining the trace type as described in the previous chapters it is
			possible to define optional attributes for the trace type.</p>
		<h3 id="Default_Editor">Default Editor</h3>
		<p>The 
			<b>defaultEditor</b> attribute of the 
			<b>org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetypeui</b>
			extension point allows for configuring the editor to use for displaying the
			events. If omitted, the 
			<i>TmfEventsEditor</i> is used as default.
		</p>
		<p>To configure an editor, first add the 
			<b>defaultEditor</b> attribute to the trace
			type in the extension definition. This can be done by selecting the trace type
			in the plug-in manifest editor. Then click the right mouse button and select

			<b>New -&gt; defaultEditor</b> in the context sensitive menu. Then select the newly
			added attribute. Now you can specify the editor id to use on the right side of
			the manifest editor. For example, this attribute could be used to implement an
			extension of the class 
			<i>org.eclipse.ui.part.MultiPageEditor</i>. The first page
			could use the 
			<i>TmfEventsEditor</i>' to display the events in a table as usual and
			other pages can display other aspects of the trace.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Events_Table_Type">Events Table Type</h3>
		<p>The  
			<b>eventsTableType</b> attribute of the 
			<b>org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetypeui</b>
			extension point allows for configuring the events table class to use in the
			default events editor. If omitted, the default events table will be used.
		</p>
		<p>To configure a trace type specific events table, first add the

			<b>eventsTableType</b> attribute to the trace type in the extension definition.
			This can be done by selecting the trace type in the plug-in manifest editor.
			Then click the right mouse button and select 
			<b>New -&gt; eventsTableType</b> in the
			context sensitive menu. Then select the newly added attribute and click on

			<i>class</i> on the right side of the manifest editor. The new class wizard will
			open. The 
			<i>superclass</i> field will be already filled with the class 
			<i>org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui.viewers.events.TmfEventsTable</i>.
		</p>
		<p>By using this attribute, a table with different columns than the default columns
			can be defined. See the class

			<i>org.eclipse.tracecompass.internal.gdbtrace.ui.views.events.GdbEventsTable</i>
			for an example implementation.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Perspective">Perspective</h3>
		<p>The  
			<b>perspective</b> element of the 
			<b>org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetypeui</b>
			extension point allows for configuring the default perspective associated with a
			trace type. If omitted, the current perspective will be used.
		</p>
		<p>To configure an associated perspective, first add the

			<b>perspective</b> element to the trace type in the extension definition.
			This can be done by selecting the trace type in the plug-in manifest editor.
			Then click the right mouse button and select 
			<b>New -&gt; perspective</b> in the
			context sensitive menu. Then select the newly added element and select the

			<i>id</i> text field on the right side of the manifest editor. Enter the associated
			perspective id, which can be found in the 
			<b>org.eclipse.ui.perspectives</b>
			extension that defines the perspective.
		</p>
		<p>By using this element, the workbench will switch to the associated perspective
			when a trace of this trace type is opened. This behavior can be controlled by a
			user dialog or preference.</p>
		<h2 id="Other_Considerations">Other Considerations</h2>
		<p>Other views and components may provide additional features that are active only
			when the event or trace type class implements certain additional interfaces.</p>
		<h3 id="Collapsing_of_repetitive_events">Collapsing of repetitive events</h3>
		<p>By implementing the interface

			<i>org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core.event.collapse.ITmfCollapsibleEvent</i> the
			event table will allow to collapse repetitive events by selecting the menu item

			<b>Collapse Events</b> after pressing the right mouse button in the table.
		</p>
		<h2 id="Best_Practices">Best Practices</h2>
		<ul>
			<li>Do not load the whole trace in RAM, it will limit the size of the trace that can be read.</li>
			<li>Reuse as much code as possible, it makes the trace format much easier to maintain.</li>
			<li>Use Eclipse's editor instead of editing the XML directly.</li>
			<li>Do not forget Java supports only signed data types, there may be special care needed to handle unsigned data.</li>
			<li>If the support for your trace has custom UI elements (like icons, views, etc.), split the core and UI parts in separate plugins, named identically except for a 
				<i>.core</i> or 
				<i>.ui</i> suffix.
				<ul>
					<li>Implement the 
						<i>tmf.core.tracetype</i> extension in the core plugin, and the 
						<i>tmf.ui.tracetypeui</i> extension in the UI plugin if applicable.
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
		<h2 id="An_Example:_Nexus-lite_parser">An Example: Nexus-lite parser</h2>
		<h3 id="Description_of_the_file">Description of the file</h3>
		<p>This is a very small subset of the nexus trace format, with some changes to make
			it easier to read. There is one file. This file starts with 64 Strings
			containing the event names, then an arbitrarily large number of events. The
			events are each 64 bits long. the first 32 are the timestamp in microseconds,
			the second 32 are split into 6 bits for the event type, and 26 for the data
			payload.</p>
		<p>The trace type will be made of two parts, part 1 is the event description, it is
			just 64 strings, comma separated and then a line feed.</p>
		<pre>
Startup,Stop,Load,Add, ... ,reserved\n
</pre>
		<p>Then there will be the events in this format</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
				<td style="width: 50%; background-color: #ffffcc;">timestamp (32 bits)</td>
				<td style="width: 10%; background-color: #ffccff;">type (6 bits)</td>
				<td style="width: 40%; background-color: #ccffcc;">payload (26 bits)</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td style="background-color: #ffcccc;" colspan="3">64 bits total</td>
			</tr>
		</table>
		<p>all events will be the same size (64 bits).</p>
		<h3 id="NexusLite_Plug-in">NexusLite Plug-in</h3>
		<p>Create a 
			<b>New</b>, 
			<b>Project...</b>, 
			<b>Plug-in Project</b>, set the title to

			<b>com.example.nexuslite</b>, click 
			<b>Next &gt;</b> then click on 
			<b>Finish</b>.
		</p>
		<p>Now the structure for the Nexus trace Plug-in is set up.</p>
		<p>Add a dependency to TMF core and UI by opening the 
			<b>MANIFEST.MF</b> in

			<b>META-INF</b>, selecting the 
			<b>Dependencies</b> tab and 
			<b>Add ...</b>

			<b>org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.core</b> and 
			<b>org.eclipse.tracecompass.tmf.ui</b>.
		</p>
		<p>
			<img border="0" src="images/NTTAddDepend.png"/>
			<br/>

			<img border="0" src="images/NTTSelectProjects.png"/>
			<br/>
		</p>
		<p>Now the project can access TMF classes.</p>
		<h3 id="Trace_Event">Trace Event</h3>
		<p>The 
			<b>TmfEvent</b> class will work for this example. No code required.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Trace_Reader">Trace Reader</h3>
		<p>The trace reader will extend a 
			<b>TmfTrace</b> class.
		</p>
		<p>It will need to implement:</p>
		<ul>
			<li>validate (is the trace format valid?)</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>initTrace (called as the trace is opened)</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>seekEvent (go to a position in the trace and create a context)</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>getNext (implemented in the base class)</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>parseEvent (read the next element in the trace)</li>
		</ul>
		<p>For reference, there is an example implementation of the Nexus Trace file in
			org.eclipse.tracecompass.tracing.examples.core.trace.nexus.NexusTrace.java.</p>
		<p>In this example, the 
			<b>validate</b> function first checks if the file
			exists, then makes sure that it is really a file, and not a directory. Then we
			attempt to read the file header, to make sure that it is really a Nexus Trace.
			If that check passes, we return a TraceValidationStatus with a confidence of 20.
		</p>
		<p>Typically, TraceValidationStatus confidences should range from 1 to 100. 1 meaning
			"there is a very small chance that this trace is of this type", and 100 meaning
			"it is this type for sure, and cannot be anything else". At run-time, the
			auto-detection will pick the type which returned the highest confidence. So
			checks of the type "does the file exist?" should not return a too high
			confidence. If confidence 0 is returned the auto-detection won't pick this type.</p>
		<p>Here we used a confidence of 20, to leave "room" for more specific trace types
			in the Nexus format that could be defined in TMF.</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>initTrace</b> function will read the event names, and find where the data
			starts. After this, the number of events is known, and since each event is 8
			bytes long according to the specs, the seek is then trivial.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>seek</b> here will just reset the reader to the right location.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>parseEvent</b> method needs to parse and return the current event and
			store the current location.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>getNext</b> method (in base class) will read the next event and update the
			context. It calls the 
			<b>parseEvent</b> method to read the event and update the
			location. It does not need to be overridden and in this example it is not. The
			sequence of actions necessary are parse the next event from the trace, create an

			<b>ITmfEvent</b> with that data, update the current location, call

			<b>updateAttributes</b>, update the context then return the event.
		</p>
		<p>Traces will typically implement an index, to make seeking faster. The index can
			be rebuilt every time the trace is opened. Alternatively, it can be saved to
			disk, to make future openings of the same trace quicker. To do so, the trace
			object can implement the 
			<b>ITmfPersistentlyIndexable</b> interface.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Trace_Context">Trace Context</h3>
		<p>The trace context will be a 
			<b>TmfContext</b>.
		</p>
		<h3 id="Trace_Location">Trace Location</h3>
		<p>The trace location will be a long, representing the rank in the file. The

			<b>TmfLongLocation</b> will be the used, once again, no code is required.
		</p>
		<h3 id="The_.27.27org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tracetype.27.27_and_.27.27org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetypeui.27.27_plug-in_extension_points">The 
			<i>org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.core.tracetype</i> and 
			<i>org.eclipse.linuxtools.tmf.ui.tracetypeui</i> plug-in extension points
		</h3>
		<p>One should use the 
			<i>tmf.core.tracetype</i> extension point in their own plug-in.
			In this example, the Nexus trace plug-in will be modified.
		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>plugin.xml</b> file in the ui plug-in needs to be updated if one wants
			users to access the given event type. It can be updated in the Eclipse plug-in
			editor.
		</p>
		<ol>

		</p>
		<p>The

		</p>
		<p>The 
			<b>event type</b> is the canonical path refering to the class of the events of a given trace.
		</p>
		<p>The  
			<b>category</b> (optional) is the container in which this trace type will be stored.
		</p>
		<ol>
			<li>(Optional) To also add UI-specific properties to your trace type, use the
