<p>
    Tests are executed tests on the following basis:
  </p>
<div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist" style="list-style-type: disc; ">
<li class="listitem"><p>
        A user-defined component is located in the user interface of
        the AUT.
      </p></li>
<li class="listitem"><p>
        The specified action is executed on this component, with the
        parameters you gave for the action.
      </p></li>
</ul></div>
<p>
    The success of an action is based on whether it was carried out
    or not. There are no implicit checks which verify the state of
    the application to check if the execution of an action actually
    had an effect. For example, if an action is carried out to click
    a button, this Test Step will be marked as successful even if
    the button is disabled. From the remote control perspective, a
    click was executed on the button component.
  </p>
<p>
    It is worth bearing this in mind if a test has failed,
    especially because of a &#8221;component not found&#8221; error. What may
    have happened is that a further component was not found due to a
    dialog still being in focus, because the
    &#8221;<span class="emphasis"><em>close</em></span>&#8221; button was disabled, for example.
    Although a click was executed on this button, it did not have
    the desired effect. The test continued, but ran into problems.
