    <div><p>Successful delivery of dynamic context-sensitive help requires a close
           coordination of UI components and UA components. It imposes responsibilities on
           both Development teams and Documentation teams, and it requires ongoing
           collaboration among those teams.
        </p>

        
        <p>Development teams must provide lists of helpKey constants to Documentation
           teams, and they must provide information about the UI control associated with
           each helpKey constant. Development teams must also provide timely updates to
           Documentation teams when any change occurs in the helpKey constants.
        </p>

        <p>Documentation teams must rely on the information provided by Development teams
           to locate the UI controls, analyze the help contexts, and create appropriate UA
           content in various formats.
        </p>

        <p>Since a context-sensitive help plug-in can contribute helpKey properties files
           and context XML files that support several UI plug-ins, Documentation teams must
           carefully evaluate the “component level” with which online documentation
           plug-ins and their corresponding context-sensitive help plug-ins are associated.
        </p>

        <p>Both Development teams and Documentation teams must rely on the project’s
           architectural specifications to determine the appropriate capabilities and
           features with which to coordinate UI and UA components.
        </p>


        <p>And finally, both Development teams and Documentation teams must test the 
            context-sensitive help UI implementation and the context-sensitive help 
            UA plug-ins.
        </p>
