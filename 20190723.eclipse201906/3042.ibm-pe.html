<h1 id="top">IBM Parallel Environment</h1>
<p>This section describes how to set up a run configuration using IBM Parallel Environment as a PTP target system configuration

<p>When running a parallel application with IBM PE, first create a C/C++/Fortran project, and build it.
For more information, see
<ul>
<li><a href="../01buildMPIprog.html">Introduction to Creating MPI Projects</a> - introduction to creating a simple project, including a synchronized project
<li><a href="../sync.html">Synchronized Projects</a> - more detail on creating and building projects on remote machines
</ul> 
<p>As described in <a href="../03pRunConfig.html">Running Parallel Programs</a>, next create a run configuration
via Run > Run Configurations ... and create a new <b>Parallel Application</b>.
<p>The specifics for running an IBM PE parallel application with PTP are specified on
the <b>Resources</b> tab of the run configuration.
For <b>Target System Configuration</b>, select <b>IBM Parallel Environment</b>
<p><img src="../images/rms-ibmpe1.png">
<p id=connection>Then specify a connection.  If you have already specified a connection, e.g.
for a <a href="../sync.html">Synchronized Project</a> or a remote project,
it will be selected already.
If you are launching a local application (on the same machine where Eclipse is running), 
select <b>Local</b> for the <b>Connection Type</b>.

<blockquote>
<p>See <a href="../remoteTools.html#create">Creating Remote Connections</a> and 
<a href="../remoteTools.html#local">Local Connections</a>

<p>Note: To edit connection information after a connection has been created, e.g. to change user name or password, see
the <a href="../remoteTools.html#edit">Editing Remote Connections</a>.
</blockquote>
<p id=pe>After selecting IBM PE, the Resources tab will be filled with information specific to this
target configuration.  
This area usually (depending on the target system configuration) includes further tabs to
segment the other information you can provide.
Fill in the IBM PE options you need. 
Here we specify, on the first sub-tab <b>Tasks</b>, to use LoadLeveler scheduling, the number of tasks, nodes, and tasks per node.
<p><img src="../images/rms-ibmpe3.png">
<p id=hover>Text fields are an easy way to specify information that will be passed to IBM PE when the job is submitted/launched.
Hover over a text field to see additional information about the data value, including the environment variable that will be populated with the values you enter.
<p><img src="../images/rms-ibmpe3-hover.png">

<p>To see the information that will be passed, via environment variables etc., to the target system, click on the
<b>View Configuration</b> button at the bottom of the Resources tab area.
<p><img src="../images/rms-ibmpe3-viewConfig.png">
<p><img src="../images/rms-ibmpe3-viewConfig2.png">

<p>Fill in other information on other tabs as needed.  For example, to fill in a LoadLeveler node allocation pool,
pool id, use the <b>Nodes</b> tab.
<p><img src="../images/rms-ibmpe4-nodes.png">

<p id=environmentVars>For Environment variables that don't have a corresponding text field or other way to enter the information
in the UI, you can use the <b>Environment</b> tab.  For example, to fill in a LoadLeveler reservation id,
create a new environment variable by clicking on the <b>New</b> button.  Enter the name and value for the variable
and click the <b>OK</b> button. The environment variable will be submitted with the job.

<p>Now continue with the 
<a href="../03pRunConfig.html#application">run configuration setup for running your parallel application</a> by specifying the Application program
on the <b>Application</b> tab, and any other information required.
