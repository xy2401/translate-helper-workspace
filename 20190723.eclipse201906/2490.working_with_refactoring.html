Once an element or file has been renamed or moved, all instances of that item within the project will be automatically updated to reflect its new name / location.</li><li>Organize Includes so that elements from one file can be referenced in another file.</li></ul><p>Refactoring should be used when you are reorganizing your project and changing names and locations of files and elements.</p><div class="note"><h4 id="note">Note:</h4><p>Refactoring will only work from within Project Explorer view.</p></div><h2 id="renaming-a-file">Renaming a File</h2><p>Renaming a file will result in the automatic renaming of all instances where that file is referenced within the project.</p><div class="ref"><p>This procedure demonstrates how to rename a file:</p><ol><li>Create a PHP file, called 'RenFile1', with the following code:</li></ol><pre><code>&lt;?php
