      <p>
         The purpose of the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.jdt.doc.user/reference/views/ref-call-hierarchy.htm">Java call hierarchy view</a>
         is to statically display all potential
         control flows originating from or leading to a specific program element.
         Since callout and callin method bindings in OT/J introduce new kinds of control flows,
         it is only appropriate to also visualize the control flows induced by such method bindings.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Whenever a given method can be invoked via a <b>callout method binding</b>,
      	the call hierarchy shows a <img src="../images/calloutbinding_obj.gif"> callout node.
      	Here all calls to the corresponding role method will be forwarded to the base method.
      </p>
      <p>
      	Whenever a <b>callin method binding</b> may intercept a given control flow,
      	a <img src="../images/callinbindingreplace_obj.gif"> callin node is shown.
      	Note, that a callin control flow is only taken at runtime, 
      	if the enclosing team is active and no guard predicate evaluates to false.
      </p>

	  <p>Additionally, whenever the call hierarchy shows the <b>lifting constructor</b> 
	    (<a href="otjld/def/s2.html#s2.3.1.b"><img src="../images/ot_paragraph.png"> 2.3.1(b &amp; c)</a>) of a role
	  	(either as an intermediate node or when requesting the call hierarchy for
	  	the role class) all those locations are considered as callers that involve
	  	lifting a base object to the given role, because the lifting operation
	  	can implicitly trigger creation of a role instance. According to
	  	<a href="otjld/def/s2.html#s2.3.b"><img src="../images/ot_paragraph.png"> 2.3(b)</a>	  	
	  	lifting can occur

	  <ul>
	  	<li>in a callout method binding (for the return value)</li>
	  	<li>in a callin method binding (call target and arguments)</li>
	  	<li>in a team method with declared lifting</li>
	  </ul>
