<h1 class="topictitle1">Using team support</h1>

<div class="p">
You can use any Eclipse-enabled repository from any
vendor. The following
information describes project-sharing using Concurrent Versions System
(CVS) support that comes with Eclipse. Steps and user interface
elements will differ depending on the repository
support that you have installed.
<div class="note"><span class="notetitle">Note: </span>When you
synchronize your RemoteSystemsConnection project with the repository
the first time, you will see many files in conflict.
This is because it takes one synchronization to properly align
the server's encoded version information with your local files. This
happens only once and you can just receive all of the incoming changes
and your local workspace will then be synchronized with the server. You
might also find inactive profiles that belong to other teammates in the Team
view after you synchronize with the central server. You can choose whether
or not to activate these profiles in the Team view if you want to see the
profile's contents in the Remote System Explorer on your local workstation.
</div>
<p>In a team programming environment, team members do work in their own workbench,
isolated from others. Eventually they will want to share their work with
their teammates. The Remote System Explorer allows them to share
their connections, filter pools, and filters. To share these resources:</p>
</div>
<ol>
<li class="skipspace">In the Remote System Explorer perspective, select the Team tab which by
  default is located in the same pane as the Remote Systems view. This
  will bring the Team view to the front of the Remote System Explorer.
  You can also use the <img src="../images/gsarrow.gif" title="" alt="menu" style="width: 24px; height: 23px;"/>
button on the Remote Systems view and select the <span style="font-weight: bold;">Work
With Profiles</span> action.<span> </span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Expand <b>RemoteSystemsConnections</b>. The profiles that you have defined, as well as the Team profile, are displayed. The Team profile is created by the Remote System Explorer to use for sharing connections, filter pools, and filters if you do not want to share them in a profile that you create and manage.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Right-click on <b>RemoteSystemsConnections</b>
and select <span><b>Team</b> &gt; <b>Share Project</b></span> . </span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select <b>CVS</b> and click <b>Next</b>.</span></li>
<li class="skipspace"><span>Select <b>Use existing repository
location </b> if you have already defined a CVS repository. Select <b>Create a new
repository</b> location if you need to define a CVS repository (this
information should be available from the person who configured the CVS
repository on the server). To create a CVS repository definition:</span>
    <ol type="a">
      <li class="skipspace"><span>In the <b>Host</b> field, type the
address of the server, for example mymachine.com. </span></li>
      <li class="skipspace"><span>In the <b>Repository path</b> field,
type the path to the repository on the server, for example /home/test, d:/test. </span></li>
      <li class="skipspace"><span>In the <b>User</b> field, type the
user name to use to connect to the repository. </span></li>
      <li class="skipspace"><span>In the <b>Password</b> field, type
the password for the user name. </span></li>
      <li class="skipspace"><span>From the <b>Connection Type</b>
list, select the authentication protocol of the CVS server. There are three
connection methods that come with the Eclipse CVS client: </span>
        <ul>
          <li><b>pserver</b>: A CVS specific connection method. </li>
          <li><b>extssh</b> : An SSH 1.0 client included with the workbench. </li>
          <li><b>ext</b>: The CVS ext connection method that uses an
external tool such as SSH to connect to the repository. The tool used
by ext is configured in the<span><b>Team</b> &gt; <b>CVS</b> &gt; <b>EXT
Connection Method</b></span> preference page. </li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li class="skipspace"><span>If the server uses a custom port,
enable <b>Use Port</b> and
enter the port number. </span></li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  <li class="skipspace"><span>Click <b>Finish</b>. The repository
location is
created. The <span style="font-weight: bold;">RemoteSystemsConnections</span> project will be created remotely and the Synchronize view will open and
  allow you to commit its resources to the server. If the project already
  exists remotely, the Synchronize view will show conflicts on any files
  that exist both locally and remotely. If the </span><span><span
 style="font-weight: bold;">RemoteSystemsConnections</span> </span><span>project
already exists in the repository when you first share it, there may be
many conflicts. Generally, these are not real conflicts, but simply considered
conflicts on the first synchronize because there is no local CVS information for the
resources in your workspace.
If you have not created any resources in your Team profile, you can
safely send or receive all of the conflicting files. If you have created
resources in your Team profile, you should check each conflicting file to ensure
there really are no differences, and if there are, resolve them by merging.</span></li>
  <li class="skipspace"><span>To synchronize your resources with those
in the associated repository, right-click on the <span style="font-weight: bold;">RemoteSystemsConnection
    </span>project, and select <span><b>Team</b> &gt; <b>Synchronize
with Repository</b></span>.</span></li>
  <li class="skipspace"><span>After sharing or synchronizing, and
receiving incoming resources from the repository, right-click on the <span
 style="font-weight: bold;">RemoteSystemsConnection </span>project,
and select <b>Reload Remote System Explorer</b>. This refreshes
the Remote System Explorer and Team view to reflect the new or changed
resources.</span></li>

<h2 class="topictitle2">Viewing the project resources in the Navigator
view</h2>
</div>
<div class="p">The Navigator view provides a hierarchical view of all
the resources in the workspace. From here, you can view the contents of the projects
that are shared, including the <span style="font-weight: bold;">RemoteSystemsConnection
</span>project, and select team-related actions on particular
resources. By default, the Navigator view is included in the Resources perspective.
To add it to the current perspective,
<ol>
  <li>Select <span><b>Window</b> &gt; <b>Show View</b> &gt; <b>Other</b></span>.</li>
  <li>Expand <b>Basic.</b> </li>
  <li>Select <b>Navigator.</b></li>
