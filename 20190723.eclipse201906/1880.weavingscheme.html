    <h1>Selecting the target weaving scheme</h1>
	<p>Running an OT/J application requires a byte code weaver for binding roles into their bases.
		Since version 2.3, the OTDT ships with two distinct weavers with
		the following properties:
	</p>
	<dl>
		<dt><strong>OTRE</strong>:</dt>
		<dd>This is the traditional <strong>load-time</strong>
			weaver. This weaver has <strong>matured</strong> over many years, but
			unfortunately, the underlying library <strong>BCEL</strong> is no
			longer maintained and thus cannot handle class files from recent Java
			versions. Up-to Java 7 this could be worked around, but Java 8 class
			files contain several elements that this BCEL-based weaver cannot
			handle.</dd>
		<dt><strong>OTDRE</strong>:<dt>
		<dd>The newer Object Teams Dynamic Runtime Environment has been developed
			to enable even <strong>runtime weaving</strong>.
			To make this work despite the fact that the JVM doesn't allow runtime-addition of new
			fields or methods, this weaver inserts a few general hooks into every weavable class (at load-time).<br/>
			This weaver is also interesting for weaving into <strong>Java 8</strong> class
			files, as it is based on the library <strong>ASM</strong>, for which
			a Java-8-enabled version already exists.</dd>
	</dl>
	<p>In short: For applications using Java 8, OTDRE is the only option.
		At Java 7 or below, OTRE is still a good option, perhaps with better performance, still.</p>
		 
	<h2>Configuration</h2>
	<h3>Project creation</h3>
	<p>
		Initial configuration of the target weaving scheme happens in the
		<a href="project.html#settings">New Object Teams Project Wizard</a>.
	</p>
	<h3>Configuring an existing project</h3>
	<p>
		For existing projects, this option can be found in the project's properties
		concerning the OT/J compiler:
	</p>
	<a href="images/screenshots/NN25/configure-compiler-weavingScheme.png"><img src="images/screenshots/NN25/configure-compiler-weavingScheme.png" width=519 alt="Selecting the weaving scheme to compile for"/></a>
	
	<p>This configuration is evaluated by the compiler and when launching an OT/J application.
		Since the <strong>OT/J compiler</strong> performs some preparation for the respective weaver,
		it has to generate different byte code formats, depending on the targeted weaving scheme.
		As a consequence, switching from one weaving scheme to the other requires a full 
		recompilation of all OT/J code involved. The runtime will detect if it encounters
		any class files compiled for an incompatible weaving scheme, signaled by throwing
		<code>UnsupportedClassVersionError</code>.
	</p>
	<h3>Running</h3>
	<p>When launching an OT/J-enabled application the suitable weaving scheme will automatically
	be selected based on the configuration of projects involved in the launch.
	</p>
