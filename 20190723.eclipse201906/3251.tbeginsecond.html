<h1 class="topictitle1">Creating a second connection to a remote server</h1>

<div class="p">
<p>In the Remote System Explorer, you can create a second connection
to the same, or a different type of server, such as Linux, UNIX, or Windows.
You can also create a second connection to the same server with a separate job
environment, for example, to specify different environment variables or different user IDs.</p>
To create a second connection:
</div>
<ol>
<li><span>In the Remote Systems view, expand <b>New Connection</b>.</span></li>
<li><span>Click the plus sign beside the type of server you to which you want to make a second connection. For example, Linux, UNIX, or Windows.</span></li>
<li><span>Complete the dialog as you normally would, making sure that you give your new connection a unique name.</span></li>
</ol>
