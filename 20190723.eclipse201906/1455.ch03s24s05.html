                there is information available to be reported that
                has not yet been reported, e.g. from a test run via
                testexec. You will also see this status if you have
                run a test via the ITE that could not report to the
                ALM system due to e.g. a connection problem. This
                allows you to report test results later, once the
                problem has been resolved.

                this status will be shown if you have run a test
                with reporting configured via the ITE, which reports
                automatically. It will also be shown if you have
                chosen to report to the ALM system after running a
                test via testexec. This status will also be shown
                even if the test run was not linked to any tasks,
                but reporting is configured for the Project. It can
                be understood as <span class="emphasis"><em>any reporting that was
                necessary has been carried out</em></span>.
                If an error occurs while reporting to one of the tasks, 
                the status will still show <span class="emphasis"><em>reported</em></span> 
                even though not all tasks were correctly updated

                if reporting information was available, but the
                information was discarded and therefore not
                reported. You can do this by selecting the option to
                discard a pending report from the context menu. This
                status will also be shown for any test runs in a
                Project that you import that had the status
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Not yet reported</em></span> when the
                Project was exported.

<dd><p>
                you will see this status for any test runs that were
                marked as relevant when the test was started and
                which have information to report (status:
                <span class="emphasis"><em>Not yet reported</em></span>),but which you
                then mark as non-relevant by toggling the relevance
                in the Test Result Summary View. This status means
                that you could report or discard the information,
                but only if you re-toggle the test run to be
                relevant.

          ALM, and click on the &#8221;<span class="emphasis"><em>Report to ALM</em></span>&#8221;
          button on the toolbar. You can also select this option
          from the context-sensitive menu. If you select multiple

          each test run.

<li class="listitem"><p>
          When you select this option, the reporting will be

          Status</em></span> column changes from <span class="emphasis"><em>Not yet

<li class="listitem"><p>
          If you do not want to report the test results to an ALM
          tool, you can discard the reporting information by
          selecting the option to discard a pending report from the
          context menu. This changes the status in the <span class="emphasis"><em>ALM
          Report Status</em></span> column from <span class="emphasis"><em>Not yet
