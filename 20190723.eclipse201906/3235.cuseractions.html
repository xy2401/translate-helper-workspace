<h1 class="topictitle1">User actions (user options)</h1>

<p>User actions are server commands that you define on the <b>Work
With
User Actions</b> window, and will run against resources such as files
and folders on your server.</p>
<div class="p">Each user action has:
<ul>
  <li>A unique name. </li>
  <li>A command (that might have substitution variables). The user
action may also
specify how the command is to be run on the server.</li>
  <li>Substitution variables that are replaced with information from
the resource (such as its name) when
the command is run.</li>
  <li>An optional comment used to describe the action in more detail.</li>
  <li>Various options to affect what happens when the command is run;
for example,
whether to prompt first.</li>
  <li>One or more file types that limit the action to specific types of
remote resources. For example, a command to start a program that
searches text files could be limited to just text files. The action is
only shown
for remote objects which is one of the specified types.</li>
