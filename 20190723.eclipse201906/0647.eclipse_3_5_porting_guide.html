<title>Eclipse JDT 3.5 Plug-in Migration Guide</title>

<h1>Eclipse JDT 3.5 Plug-in Migration Guide</h1>
<p>This guide covers migrating Eclipse JDT 3.4 plug-ins to Eclipse JDT 3.5.</p>
<p>One of the goals of Eclipse 3.5 was to move Eclipse forward while remaining compatible 
  with previous versions to the greatest extent possible. That is, plug-ins written 
  against the Eclipse 3.4 APIs should continue to work in 3.5 in spite of the 
  API changes.</p>
<p>The key kinds of compatibility are API contract compatibility and binary compatibility. 
  API contract compatibility means that valid use of 3.4 APIs remains valid for 
  3.5, so there is no need to revisit working code. Binary compatibility means 
  that the API method signatures, etc. did not change in ways that would cause 
  existing compiled (&quot;binary&quot;) code to no longer link and run with the 
  new 3.5 libraries.</p>
<p>While every effort was made to avoid breakage, there are a few areas of incompatibility or new
  APIs that should be adopted by clients. 
  This document describes those areas and provides instructions for migrating 3.4 plug-ins to 
  3.5.</p>
