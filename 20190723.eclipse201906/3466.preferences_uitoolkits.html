      <p>This page is used to control various <strong>UI Toolkits</strong> options.</p>
	<p>WindowBuilder is designed with a plugable system to support creating user 
	interfaces in different UI toolkits. The available toolkits include SWT, 
	Swing, and the Google Web Toolkit (GWT).<br>
	<br>
	The preference page shows the available toolkits and indicates which ones 
	are already installed. The list of available toolkits is refreshed from the 
	Eclipse servers when the preference page is opened. To install a new UI 
	toolkit into WindowBuilder, select the desired toolkit and click the <strong>
	Install Toolkits...</strong> button. WindowBuilder will verify that the 
	toolkit's update site is live and then hand off the installation process to 
	the standard Eclipse install dialog.</p>

	<p>Installed tookits may be uninstalled using he <strong>Uninstall Toolkit</strong> 
	button.</p>
	<p>The <strong>Show uninstalled toolkits in the new wizard dialog</strong> 
	determines whether uninstalled toolkits show up with a placeholder in the
	<strong>New Wizard</strong> under the <strong>WindowBuilder</strong> 
	category.</p>

	<p>Selecting an uninstalled toolkit and clicking <strong>Next</strong> will 
	present the user with the option of installing editing support for that 
	toolkit. Clicking Finish will hand off the installation process to the 
	standard Eclipse install dialog as shown above.</p>
