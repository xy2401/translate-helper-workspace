See '<a href="../tasks/adding_a_server_path_map.html">Adding a Server Location Path Map</a>' for more information.</li><li>Automatically whenever a file is debugged - A Path Map is automatically set between the path to the debug target's parent project (the parent project of the file from which the debugging process has been launched - e.g. C:\Workspace\MyProject) and the debug target's project in the Workspace (e.g. MyProject).</li><li>Through the Path Mapping dialog. This is launched during debugging whenever a file defined with an absolute path (See '<a href="include_paths.html">Include Paths</a>' for more on absolute file locations) is called and found .  In this scenario, a Path Mapping dialog will appear with a list of 'similar files' to the one being called.  'Similar' files are files with the same name as the called file that are situated in the following locations:</li><ul><li>Files in the project from which the file was called.</li><li>Files in projects that are in the Include Paths of the project from which the file was called.</li><li>Files that are open in a PDT editor.</li></ul></ol><div class="note"><h4 id="note3">Note:</h4><p>If the debug/profile session was triggered from the Zend Debugger Toolbar, all files in the Workspace with the same name will be listed.</p></div><p><img style="border-width: 0px;" alt="Path Mapping file options Dialog" title="Path Mapping file options Dialog" src="images/path_mapping_options_pdt.png"/></p><div class="note"><h4 id="note4">Note:</h4><p>The dialog will not appear if a Path Mapping to the called location has already been defined.</p></div><p>Selecting a file from the list results in a Path Map being created between the called remote file's parent folder and the parent folder of the 'similar' file selected from the list. This means that every time a file is called from the same parent folder, will be searched for in the selected Workspace/local folder and opened during Debugging/Profiling .</p><p>If none of the options in the Matching items list represent your desired file location, you may select the 'Do not map the following server path to a local resource: ' option. This means that, during the debugging/profiling process, whenever this path is called, no files will open in the editor.  You can click Configure to modify the path to include any parent or child directories.</p><div class="links"><h4 id="related-links">Related Links:</h4><ul><li><a href="../tasks/adding_elements_to_a_project_s_include_path.html">Include Paths</a></li><li><a href="../tasks/adding_a_server_path_map.html">Adding a Server Location Path Map</a></li><li><a href="../reference/preferences/php_servers.html">PHP Servers Preferences</a></li><li><a href="../tasks/debugging/index.html">Using the Debugger</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer">
