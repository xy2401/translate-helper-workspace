<h1 class="topictitle1">Configuring environment variable support for connections</h1>

<p>Environment variables are set for the remote job process
when you first connect to a remote system. This means that the results
of setting the variables are shown in the Remote Shell view.
If the system type you are using is case sensitive (UNIX for example),
then the environment variables will also be case sensitive. Spaces and
equals signs (=) are only allowed in the value for the environment
variable, not in
its name.</p>
<p>You can define environment variables for all Remote System Explorer
connection types that support them (Windows, Linux, UNIX, and other
system types that are installed).</p>
<p>If you change an environment variable while the Remote System
Explorer is connected to a
remote server, the change does not take affect until you disconnect and
reconnect.</p>
<p>Although environment variables are set in subsystem properties
pages, the Remote System Explorer stores
them globally by connection.</p>
<p>If you need to specify different environment variables or user IDs
for a particular remote system, you can do so by defining multiple
connections to that
remote system and then defining the environment variables on the file
subsystem for each
connection.</p>
<p>To configure environment variables:
</p>
<ol>
  <li><span>Create a connection to a server if necessary.</span></li>
  <li><span>Expand your connection name in the Remote Systems view.</span></li>
  <li><span>Right-click on a file subsystem and select <b>Properties</b>.</span></li>
  <li><span>Click <b>Environment Variables</b> and configure the variables as needed.</span>
    <ul>
      <li>To add an environment variable, click <b>Add</b>. Enter a
name and value for this variable, and click<b>OK</b>.</li>
      <li>To change an environment variable, select the variable in the
table and modify the name or value directly. To use a dialog box,
select the variable and click <b>Change</b>. The name and value of the
current variable
are pre-filled in the dialog box. Overwrite whichever field you want to
change and click <b>OK</b>.</li>
      <li>To remove a variable, click the variable to select it and
click <b>Remove</b>.</li>
      <li>To move a variable up in the list, click the variable to
select it and click <b>Move up</b>.</li>
      <li>To move a variable down in the list, click the variable to
select it and click <b>Move down</b>.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ol>
