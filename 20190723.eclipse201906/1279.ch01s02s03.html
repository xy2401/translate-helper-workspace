<p>
    Writing tests in some kind of scripting language is certainly
    powerful, but it puts a strain on the resources of a team,
    because the test code itself becomes a project in its own right
    and also needs to be checked and maintained. The extra costs
    added by programming GUI tests can be considerable.
  </p>
<p>
    Tests written in code also have the problem that they no longer
    view the software as a black box and may miss important aspects
    relating to the acceptance. In addition, automation experts
    (experienced software developers) become the only people who can
    write or maintain tests. It is generally inadvisable to test
    your own work, but this is what can happen if testing remains
    solely in the realm of the developers. Writing tests without
    coding from the black box perspective not only allows test
    experts to automate tests (and therefore brings the test
    perspective to the forefront), but also puts developers in the
    shoes of the users, which helps to focus and improve the test.
