<h1 id="top">Remote Generic Interactive</h1>
<p>This section describes how to set up a run configuration using the "Remote Generic Interactive" 
as a target system configuration for the <a href="../toc.html">Parallel Tools Platform (PTP)</a>.

<p>This target system configuration (TSC) is a simple way to launch a job on a remote system,
not especially a parallel job.
 
<p>As described in <a href="../03pRunConfig.html">Running Parallel Programs</a>, create a run configuration
via Run > Run Configurations ... and create a new <b>Parallel Application</b>.
<p>The specifics for running the remote program with PTP are specified on
the <b>Resources</b> tab of the run configuration.
For <b>Target System Configuration</b>, select <b>Remote-Generic-Interactive</b>
<p><img src="../images/rms-remote-generic-interative.png">
<p>Then specify a connection.  If you have already specified a connection, e.g.
for a <a href="../sync.html">Synchronized Project</a> or a remote project,
you can select it, or you can create a new connection at this point with the <b>New...</b> button.

<p><img src="../images/rms-remote-generic-interative-conn.png">
<blockquote>
<p>For how to create a connection, see <a href="../remoteTools.html#create">Creating Remote Connections</a> and 
<a href="../remoteTools.html#local">Local Connections</a>

<p>Note: To edit connection information after a connection has been created, e.g. to change user name or password, see
<a href="../remoteTools.html#edit">Editing Remote Connections</a>.
</blockquote>
<p>After selecting a Connection, it will ask to run a command on the system.
Select <b>Yes</b> to continue.  Check the <b>Don't ask to run command again for this configuration</b>
to avoid being asked again for this launch configuration.  The information from the command results are generally used
to populate information on the dialog.

<p>On the <b>Application</b> tab (as described in 
<a href="../03pRunConfig.html#application">run configuration setup for running your parallel application</a>),
for the <b>Remote-Generic-Interactive</b> target system configuration,
the application name shouldn't be the executable name, but a run script that is provided by the user.

<ul>
<li>For this example, we created a simple synchronized project that contains a "hello world" script
<pre>
#!/bin/bash
# hello.sh
echo "Hello PTP Remote Generic Interactive World"
</pre>
</ul>
Use the <b>Browse...</b> button to select the script from a location on the remote target system.
<p><img src="../images/rms-remote-generic-interative-app-script.png">
<p>Select the <b>Run</b> button to execute the script.
The results from this simple "hello world" script are shown in the <b>Console</b> view at the bottom
of the workbench window.
