<p>Eclipse QVTd is an Open Source project. All code has been developed under the auspices of Eclipse.</p>
<p>Eclipse QVTd is a largely one man development by Ed Willink who has been the OMG QVT 
				<em class="glossterm">RTF</em> (Revision Task Force) chair since QVT 1.2. Expect further revisions of the QVT specification to exploit feedback from the Eclipse QVTo and QVTd projects.
			</p>
<p>There is now a significant personnel and corporate overlap between the Eclipse QVTd committers and the OMG QVT RTF and so Eclipse OCL is pioneering solutions to many of the under-specification problems in the OCL specification.</p>
<p>Ed Willink is also project lead of the Eclipse OCL where the new pivot-based implementation prototypes solutions to many problems with the OMG OCL specification for which Ed Willink has been the RTF chair since OCL 2.4.</p>
<p>The many aspects of OCL and QVTd are converging; help welcome.</p>
