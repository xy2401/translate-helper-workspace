<h1 class="topictitle1">Universal Systems</h1>

<p>At a minimum the Remote System Explorer provides access to
Linux,
UNIX, and Windows systems. These are called "universal" systems
since their file and command systems are quite similar. You can
export,
import, explore remote files, and run remote
commands on all of these system types.
You can also drag/drop and copy/paste between
two systems of the same or different type.
For example, you can drag and drop a file
from your Windows host to your Linux host,
from one Linux host to another, or from one
file in your Linux host to another file in
the same host.</p>
<p>The Remote System Explorer can also provide access to other types of
systems if the support is installed in the workbench. Examples of
such systems might be IBM iSeries or zSeries server systems.<br />
