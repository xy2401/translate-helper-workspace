It does this by making tasks a top priority, and integrating rich and offline editing for repositories such as Bugzilla, Trac, and JIRA. Once your tasks are integrated, Mylyn monitors your work activity to identify relevant information, and uses this task context to focus the user interface on the task-at-hand. This puts the information you need at your fingertips and improves productivity by reducing searching, scrolling, and navigation. By making task context explicit Mylyn also facilitates multitasking, planning, reusing past efforts, and sharing expertise.</p><p>The Task List allows you to view and manage your tasks. The Task List contains both "Local Tasks" and shared "Repository Tasks" that are stored in a task repository such as Bugzilla or Jira. Local tasks are typically contained in categories. Repository tasks are contained in special categories that represent queries.</p><h2 id="mylyn-features-the-following">Mylyn features the following:</h2><ul><li>Task List Presentation</li><li>Icon Legend and Color Coding</li><li>Creating New Tasks</li><li>Using Local Tasks</li><li>Repository Tasks</li><li>Task Focused Interface</li><li>Task Focused Ordering</li><li>Task Hyperlinking</li></ul><p>For more information see the <a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/index.php/Mylyn/User_Guide">Mylyn User Guide</a>.</p><div class="links"><h4 id="related-links">Related Links:</h4><ul><li><a href="../tasks/mylyn_integration1.html">Working with Mylyn Integration</a></li></ul></div><div class="footer">
