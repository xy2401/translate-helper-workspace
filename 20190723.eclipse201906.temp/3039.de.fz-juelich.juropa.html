<h1 id="top">Running batch jobs on JUROPA</h1>
<p><a href="http://www.fz-juelich.de/ias/jsc/EN/Expertise/Supercomputers/JUROPA/JUROPA_node.html">JUROPA</a>
is a computing resource at the Juelich Supercomputing Centre.
<p>In order to run a batch job on JUROPA from PTP, first create a C/C++/Fortran project, and build it.
For more information, see
<ul>
<li><a href="../01buildMPIprog.html">Introduction to creating MPI projects</a>
which includes information on building
<li><a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.pldt.doc.user/html/setup.html">Setting up an MPI project with PTP's PLDT</a>
<li><a href="../sync.html">Synchronized Projects</a> - creating and building projects on remote machines
</ul> 
<p>As described in <a href="../03pRunConfig.html">Running Parallel Programs</a>, next create a run configuration
via Run &gt; Run Configurations ... and create a new <b>Parallel Application</b>.

<p>Choose <b>de.fz-juelich.juropa.torque.batch</b> as target system configuration.</p>

<p>Since JUROPA is running a TORQUE/MOAB combination as batch system, the main configuration is similar
to the <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.rm.jaxb.doc.user/html/PBSHelpPage.html">Torque-Generic-Batch</a> target system configuration. The Basic Settings for a job submission on JUROPA
are shown in the following snap shot.</p>

<p>
In addition to the usual parameters for TORQUE batch scripts, you can choose the number of processes per node (ppn),
which can also be interpreted as number of CPUs per node.
Via <b>Threads per Task (tpt)</b> one can configure to launch multiple threads for each MPI task.
In general, the number of MPI tasks can be derived from the prior parameters <b>nodes</b>, <b>ppn</b> and <b>tpt</b>.
The corresponding formula can be found in the description of the MPI tasks field. It is 
dynamically updated with the values set for the three parameters.
</p>

<p>
The shown configuration leads to the batch script presented in the following snap shot.
You can check the status of the batch script generated with your current parameters
by clicking on the <b>View Script</b> button.

<p>
Finally, you have to select the binary, which has to be executed, on the <b>Application</b> tab.
Once your configuration is complete, you can click on the <b>Run</b> button to submit your job.
The batch script is sent to JUROPA's batch system Moab via <b>msub</b>.
</p>
<p>For more information see the 
<a href="../03pRunConfig.html#application">run configuration setup for running your parallel application</a> 
which also describes specifying the Application program
on the <b>Application</b> tab, and specifying any other information required.
