<p>The CPS domain specifies application and host types and their instances, requests and requirements on applications and resource requirements of applications towards hosts. Application types have a state machine that describes their behavior through states and transitions. Finally, application instances can be allocated to host instances that can communicate with each other.</p>

<p>Host instances have a unique node IP address.</p>

<p>Transitions may specify an action for sending or waiting for a signal. A signal can be sent by providing an application type (with its ID) and a signal identifier, while waiting for a signal is done by specifying its identifier.</p>

<p>In the deployment model, host instances contain the applications that are running on them, while each application has a behavior with states and transitions. The behavior has a current state and transitions may trigger other transitions when the triggered transition is waiting for the signal they are sending and the application type is correct.</p>
