<p class="Para">EGF (Eclipse Generation Factories) is a software factory tool with the purpose to generate software artifacts, such as code or application.</p>

<p class="Para">A major concern in software engineering is to deliver on time with the expected level of quality, 
	while requirements and development environments evolve and are more and more complex. 
	In order to meet those needs, the generative technique is a means which avoids wasting time and efforts.</p> 
<p class="Para">The purpose of EGF is to provide an extensible model-based generation framework in order to automate software production.
	It provides the support to define and customize software factories.</p>
