<h1>Introduction to Creating MPI Projects</h1>
<p>This section provides a simple introduction with examples, for creating, building and launching an MPI program. 
<p>Two different creation scenarios are covered:
<ol>
<li><a href="#sync">Creating a synchronized MPI project with a Makefile</a>
<p>This is an example of a parallel program to be built and run on a remote machine.  Source files are edited
on the local (Eclipse) machine and then it can be built and run on a remote target machine.

</li>
<li><a href="#local-helloMPI">Creating a local MPI project without an explicitly provided Makefile - a "Managed Build"  project</a>
with "Hello MPI World"  sample source code
<p>This is an example of a small MPI program to create and edit on the local machine - as an
introduction to using Eclipse to develop C and MPI source codes.
</li>
</ol>

<!-- ------ -->

<h2 id="sync">Creating a Synchronized MPI project with a Makefile</h2>
<p>
<p>This describes creating a synchronized project with an explicitly provided Makefile - a "Makefile"  project.
Actually this doesn't require a makefile - it means that the user provides a build command, and the default build command is "make".
This can be easily changed for other build mechanisms.
<p>It will cover the following steps:
<ul>
<li><a href="#sync-create">Step 1: Create the Project</a> from source code existing on the remote target machine. 
The files are copied to the local machine.
<li><a href="#sync-term">Step 2: (Optional) Open a Remote Terminal View on the remote machine</a>
<li><a href="#sync-edit">Step 3: Edit Source Files</a> - and set up remote include files too
<li><a href="#sync-build">Step 4: Build the executable on the remote machine</a>
<li><a href="#sync-launch">Step 5: Launch the program</a>
</ul>

<h3 id="sync-create">Step 1: Create the project</h3>
<p>We assume for this example that the source code exists on the remote target machine.
<pre>
<code>
$> pwd
/u/userid/shallow
$> ls
calc.c  copy.c  decs.h  diag.c  dump.c  init.c  main.c  Makefile  time.c  tstep.c  tstep.f90  worker.c
</code></pre>
<p>In the Project Explorer view, right click, then choose <b>New > Synchronized C/C++ Project</b>
if your project is C/C++ only.  
<ul><li>
If your project contains Fortran files, Choose <b>New > Synchronized Fortran Project</b>.  
(This adds a Fortran nature to the project so you can access Fortran properties, etc.)
See <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.photran.doc.user/html/toc.html">Photran</a> for more details
on Eclipse features for Fortran.
</li></ul>

<p>
<img src="images/01sync-newProj.png">
<p>&nbsp;
<p>In the <b>New Synchronized Project</b> wizard, enter the project name, e.g. "shallow"
<p>
<img src="images/01sync-newProj2.png">
<p>The <b>Local Directory</b> specifies where the local files are located. The default value is a directory 
under your Eclipse workspace directory, so leave this as is.
<p>The <b>Remote Directory</b> specifies where the remote files are located, so we must tell Eclipse where it is.
<p>Here we create a new connection to the remote machine.

Then select the <b>New...</b> button next to <b>Connection:</b>
to create a new connection.
<blockquote><b>Note:</b> if your dialog also asks for <b>Remote Services Provider</b>, 
then the default remote services provider is not set in <b>Preferences</b> under <b>Remote Development</b>.
</blockquote>
<p>
<img src="images/01sync-newProj2a.png">
<ul><li>If a connection already exists, simply select it.</li></ul>
<h4 id="newconn">Creating a new connection</h4>
<p>The <b>New Connection</b> dialog appears.
Enter a name for the connection in <b>Connection name:</b>
and enter the host name, user name, and password.
<p>
<img src="images/01sync-newConn.png">
<p>&nbsp;
<p>If your machine access requires ssh access through a frontend/intermediate node, use localhost and port -
see 
<a href="remoteTools.html#tunnel">SSH tunneling</a>

<p>Select <b>Finish</b> when the connection information is filled in.
<p>Back on the wizard dialog, once the connection has been created, choose the remote location
of the source files of your project - for <b>Remote Directory</b>, select the <b>Browse</b> button.
Note that this is the first time the connection information is used, so if you have specified
hostname, userid, or password incorrectly it will fail.
If you do get an error connecting, and you need to change the host name, userid or password in the connection, you can:
<ul>
<li>create another connection right here
in the new sync project wizard.  You can always delete the first one later ... or
<li>cancel out of the new project wizard and see
<a href="remoteTools.html#edit">editing connection information</a>
to change the connection information.
</ul>

<p>If the connection information is successful, the <b>Browse</b> button will pop up a  dialog on the remote system
allowing you to select the <b>Project Location</b> on that system.
Select the location of your source files - or create a new directory to which you can
add files later - and select <b>OK</b>.
<p>
<p>
<img src="images/01sync-newProjBrowse.png">


<p>Back in the new project wizard, choose the project type and toolchain(s).
If you are synchronizing with an existing directory of source code and have your own
makefile (or other build command), choose a <b>Project type</b> of <b>Makefile Project > Empty Project</b>.
For <b>Remote Toolchain</b>, choose the toolchain that most closely matches the remote system.

<ul>
<li><i>Empty project</i> only indicates that Eclipse isn't adding any files to the project - it will use your files.
<li>
Note: toolchain information is only  used for scanner discovery in determining the location
of the include files, etc. that are used in your build - to help Eclipse find the same information
to help with editor navigation, special features, etc.
Actual build command information is taken from your Makefile.
</ul>

If you intend to build locally (on the same machine where Eclipse is installed)
then specify a local toolchain as well.  A local toolchain is not necessary.
<p>
<img src="images/01sync-newProj3.png">
<p>If you want to control which files get synchronized back to the local machine, for example, to 
not sync binary files that are built on the remote machine, choose <a href="sync.html#file-filter">File Filtering</a>.
By default all files are synchronized between the local and remote systems
(including binaries).
<p>Select <b>Finish</b> to complete the sync project setup.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>For more details on synchronization, configurations, filters, Synchronization properties,
etc. see <a href="sync.html">Synchronized Projects</a>.

<h3 id="sync-term">Step 2: (Optional) Open a remote terminal on the remote machine</h3
>
<p>Since this example describes how to create a synchronized project mirrored on a remote machine,
it assumes a directory on the remote machine exists with source code and a Makefile already existing in it.

While using the remote terminal within Eclipse is not necessary to create the project, this is a
good point to demonstrate doing so and show what files exist on the remote machine for this example.
<p>See <a href="remoteTerminal.html">Remote Terminal</a>
for how to connect with shell access to the remote system, within an Eclipse view,
using the same information already available in the connection you created for the synchronized
project.
<ul>
<li>Summary: in the <b>Terminal</b> view, select the <img src="images/rterm_icon_connect.png"> <b>Connect</b> button 
to use the existing connection in the Terminal window.
</ul>
<p>This example shows the files in the remote directory that are mirrored in the synchronized
project within Eclipse PTP.
<br><img src="images/01sync-term.png">
<h3 id="sync-edit">Step 3: Edit source files</h3>
<p>To edit a source file, double-click on a file in the Project explorer view.
The editor opens on that file.

You may see <a href="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.ptp.pldt.doc.user/html/codan.html">Codan</a> errors on lines that use APIs
from include files that aren't on your system, and in the Eclipse
<b>Problems</b> view.
<p><img src="images/01edit-codanErrors.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>To remove the Codan errors, you can either
<ul>
<li>Turn off Codan errors (easiest) or
<li>Specify remote include files on the remote target machine for the synchronized project.
</ul>
To tell Eclipse about remote include files see
<a href="includes.html">Include files for Synchronized Projects</a>.
<p>&nbsp;
<p>With include files successfully specified (or Codan errors turned off), the editor errors
should go away:
<p><img src="images/01edit-no-codanErrors.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;
<h3 id="sync-build">Step 4: Build the executable on the remote machine</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Assuming that you have MPI installed on the remote 
system and accessible via PATH, etc, it can now be built.
</p>
<p>A build can be initiated by using the <b>Project &gt; Build Project</b>  menu 
or selecting the project in
the <b>Project Explorer</b> view and selecting the 
<img src="images/01sync-hammer-icon.png">
hammer icon in the toolbar.
If the hammer icon or other build options are not available, it probably means
there is no project selected in the <b>Project Explorer</b> view.
<br>
<p><img src="images/01sync-buildIconsToolbar.png"></p>
</li>
<p>&nbsp;
<li><p>The files are synchronized prior to the build to assure
the current versions are used, and after the build to synchronize the
results of the build back to the local project.
(If you do not want binaries from the remote system synchronized back to the local
project, see <a href="sync.html#file-filter">File Filters</a>.)
You can see the results of the build in the console view.
(Click on the <b>Console</b> tab near the bottom  of the Eclipse workbench.)

<p><img src="images/01sync-build-console.png"></p>
<p>&nbsp;
<p>
Once the build is complete, any errors  (e.g. compile errors) will be displayed in the 
<b>Problems view</b>, the 
corresponding source files will be flagged, and markers will be inserted into the editor window.</p><p><br></p>
<p>To force a sync of the files between the local and remote copies at any time, select the project in the <b>Project Explorer</b> view 
and use the <img src="images/01sync-icon.png"> Sync button in the toolbar.
</li>
</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="sync-launch">Step 5: Launch the program</h3>
<p></p>
<p>Once you have verified that the application has built correctly, you can then

<h3 id="build">Step 3: Build the executable</h3>
<p></p>
<ol>
<li><p>Assuming that you have MPI installed and that the project was configured correctly, the application should now automatically build. 
When the automatic 
build setting is selected, Eclipse will build the application whenever you save changes in an editor. 
Automatic/manual build can be toggled by selecting <b>Project &gt; Build Automatically...</b>. 
</p>
<p>A build can be initiated manually using <b>Project &gt; Build Project</b> or selecting the project in
the Project Explorer view and selecting the hammer icon in the toolbar.

<p><img src="images/01wbSrcEditor.png"></p><p><br></p>
</li>
<li><p>Details of the commands that were executed to complete the build can be seen in the <b>Console 
view</b> (click on the <b>Console</b> tab near the bottom right hand corner of the Eclipse 
workbench.)</p></li>
<p>
<li>Note: this project assumes that the command <b>mpicc</b> will build an MPI program on your system.
If your MPI build command is different, you can access the 
<a href="misc.html#projProps">Project Properties</a> to view or change it.
</a>

<p>To change the MPI command, in the project properties, select <b>C/C++ Build > Settings </b> and on the <b>GCC C Compiler</b>
tree item, change the <b>Command:</b> string from mpicc to whatever your MPI build command may be.
