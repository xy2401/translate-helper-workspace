<title>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.5 and 3.6</title>

<h1>Incompatibilities between Eclipse 3.5 and 3.6</h1>

<p>
  Eclipse changed in incompatible ways between 3.5 and 3.6 in ways that affect 
  plug-ins. The following entries describe the areas that changed and provide 
  instructions for migrating 3.5 plug-ins to 3.6. Note that you only need to look 
  here if you are experiencing problems compiling or running your 3.5 plug-in on 3.6.

<h2>1. <a name="dialogSettings">DialogSettings.save(Writer writer) can throw an IOException</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that call DialogSettings.save(Writer writer) in code that is compiled against release 3.5</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In release 3.4 and earlier, DialogSettings.save(Writer writer) was specified
to throw an <code>IOException</code>.  In release 3.5, the method signature was changed to not throw the
exception.  In release 3.6, the method is specified to throw the exception (restoring it to the release 3.4 
and earlier specification).  Clients that do not catch the IOException when calling DialogSettings.save(Writer writer)
should update the code to catch the exception.  Note that this source incompatibility only applies to clients who
directly use <code>DialogSettings</code>, the default implementation class.  The interface type, <code>IDialogSettings</code>,
has remained consistent in throwing the IOException in the method signature, so clients using the interface type are not
affected.</p>

<h2>2. <a name="minTextCellWidth">The TextCellEditor no longer sets a default width of 50</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients relying on the default value for the minimum width of a
 TextCellEditor.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The javadoc for <tt>TextCellEditor#getLayoutData()</tt> states explicitly that
there is no minimum width set but it was inheriting a default width of 50. Clients who were relying on
the previous value of 50 should override the <tt>minimumWidth</tt> field of the cell's <tt>LayoutData</tt> explicitly.
</p>

<!-- ############################################## -->

<h2>3. <a name="FileSystemFetchTree">The method FileSystem.fetchFileTree now throws CoreException</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Subclasses of <tt>org.eclipse.core.filesystem.provider.FileSystem</tt>
that invoked super in their implementation of <tt>fetchFileTree(IFileStore, IProgressMonitor)</tt></p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> This method previously did not declare a throws clause, even
though the base interface <tt>IFileSystem</tt> method did. This prevented clients from ever
throwing <tt>CoreException</tt> in their implementations of this method, so the method signature
was changed to be consistent with the base interface. This is a binary compatible change,
but results in a source incompatibility for clients originally implemented against Eclipse 3.5 or earlier.
</p>

<h2>4. <a name="exemplarySetup">The bundle org.eclipse.equinox.p2.exemplarysetup has been removed</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Applications or features including p2 or manually
starting p2.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> The bundle <tt>org.eclipse.equinox.p2.exemplarysetup</tt> 
has been removed from the Eclipse platform in the 3.6 release. This bundle never contained any API, 
either real or provisional, and just contained some classes used to initialize p2 that are no longer needed. 
There are some client applications that may be affected:</p> 
<ol>
	<li>If you have a custom product or feature that incorporates p2 bundles directly rather 
	than through the <tt>org.eclipse.equinox.p2.user.ui</tt> feature provided by the platform, 
	you will need to remove this extra bundle from your .product file or feature.xml.</li>
	<li>Some advanced client applications were manually starting this bundle in order to ensure p2 
	was started. Manual initialization of p2 is no longer needed and any such code can be removed.</li>
</ol>

<h2>5. <a name="objectContribution">Object Contributions will not execute from a key binding</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Key bindings assigned to a command backed by an object contribution action.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> A fundamental flaw in the legacy action/command bridge was fixed 
in the 3.6 release.  While command definitionIds have been allowed on objectContributions
so they can display key bindings while the context
menu is up, objectContributions do not support execution using key bindings and objectContributions
cannot be handlers for commands.  In 3.4 a leak was
introduced that allowed some IResource based objectContributions to execute from a key binding.
With this leak now fixed, plug-ins that wish to provide default behaviour for a key binding for
their command must provide a handler.  This does not affect ActionSets, which will continue to
work with key bindings when active within a perspective. 
</p>
An example of writing a core expression that's similar to an objectContribution can be found at
<a href="http://wiki.eclipse.org/Menu_Contributions/IFile_objectContribution">IFile objectContribution
Example</a>.

<h2>6. <a name="spinner">Spinner now allows setting equal minimum and maximum values</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients that expect setting a single value range on a Spinner control to be disallowed.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> Prior to Eclipse 3.6, attempts to set a Spinner's value range to a
single value were not allowed.  This was done in order to be consistent with
other range-based controls in SWT.  However the case of specifying a single
integer value as a Spinner's value range is valid, so this is now allowed. 
Clients that were dependent on this case being disallowed must now check for
this condition before setting a Spinner's maximum to a value that would match
its minimum value (or vice versa), and not set the value in such cases.
</p>

<!-- ############################################## -->

<h2>7. <a name="safari">Browser on OS X now returns "webkit" as its type</a></h2>
<p><strong>What is affected:</strong> Clients using the result of <code>Browser.getBrowserType()</code> on OS X.</p>
<p><strong>Description:</strong> In Eclipse 3.5.x the Browser returned "safari" as its type on OS X.  However this
return value was not accurate since it is the WebKit framework that is embedded by the Browser control on OS X, not
the Safari application, so it has been changed accordingly.  Clients that were using this return value to detect the
use of a WebKit-based native browser on OS X should now detect a return value of "webkit" from <code>Browser.getBrowserType()</code>
<em>and</em> check <code>SWT.getPlatform()</code> for a return value of either "carbon" or "cocoa".
