<h1 class="topictitle1">Shells and commands in the Remote Systems view</h1>

<p>You can use the Remote Shell view to run and interact with commands
and command shells on universal systems. A universal system includes Windows,
Linux, and UNIX system types.<br/>
</p>
<p>Specifically, use the view to: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Run commands in a command shell</li>
  <li>Display and interpret the output of a program</li>
  <li>Enter input to a program</li>
  <li>Display and manage different commands and shells from the same
view. Multiple commands can be run in a single shell (one command at a time per
shell), multiple shells may be run on a single system, and multiple systems may be
running shells.</li>
</ul>
<p>Whenever a command shell is launched or a command is run from within
Remote System Explorer, the Remote Shell view is used to display the output
and provide a way to work with that output. </p>
