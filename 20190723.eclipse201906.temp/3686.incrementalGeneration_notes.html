<p>
        The incremental generation process can only be used with EMF-based models.
        That's because all intermediate artifacts
        (<span class="emphasis">
<em>diff model</em>
</span> and <span class="emphasis">
<em>trace model</em>
</span>)
        which reference the original models are also stored as EMF models. It is
        therefore not possible to refer to other model formats. Moreover, you
        should make sure that your model has stable IDs for the individual
        model elements so that the model comparison doesn't run into any
        ambiguities.
      </p>
<p>
      	Also note that at the moment, Xpand cannot track access to model elements
      	from JAVA extensions. This can lead to cases where a change in a specific
      	model element should trigger a specific (set of)
      	file(s) to be regenerated, but it actually doesn't.
      	That's because Xpand didn't know about the
      	model element being accessed during the original file generation,
      	so it has no indication that a regeneration is required. For that reason
      	you should try to access your model as much as possible from Xpand or
      	Xtend, and only resort to JAVA code when it is unavoidable.

<p>
        The main performance benefits of incremental generation come from
        <span class="emphasis">
<em>not</em>
</span> doing things that are not necessary. Given
        the workflow from <a class="xref" href="incrementalGeneration_usage.html#incrementalGeneration_usage_callback" title="The Incremental Generation Callback">the section called “The Incremental Generation Callback”</a>,
        it may seem counterproductive to first
        perform a costly model comparison operation before it can even be
        determined whether a file has to be generated or not.
      </p>
<p>
        While it is true that model comparison is a very expensive operation,
        it turns out that it still outweighs the costs of unnecessarily
        generating files, even if no postprocessing or subsequent compiler
        invocation is involved.
      </p>
<p>
        That said, it is definitely preferrable to do without a model comparison
        and rather capture the changes to the model on-the-fly. So whenever
        you are working in a controlled environment, you may want to consider a
        customized integration of the generator invocation with the
        model editors.
