  <h1>Server Push</h1>

  <p>
    Sometimes it's necessary to “push” UI updates from the RAP server to the RAP client.
    As an example, imagine a chat application that notifies the user of a chat request from a peer.
  </p>
  <p>
    HTTP is not designed to actively push data to the client.
    A RAP server can only answer requests from a
    <a href="client.html">client</a>, but it cannot actively send any message
    to the client. In RAP the UI is typically updated
    within a request caused by a user interaction, in which case this restriction is not an issue.
    However, when the UI is <a href="threads.html#asyncexec">updated from a background thread</a>,
    there's usually no request that could fetch the UI updates from the server.
    In this case the UI changes would not be rendered until the next HTTP request is triggered.
  </p>

  <h2>The Solution</h2>

  <p>
    Using the so-called Comet (or “long polling”) approach, the server is able to notify the client
    <em>immediately</em>. The basic idea is that the client sends a request to the server that is
    not answered until the server needs to notify the client of a change.
  </p>
  <p>
    RAP provides an implementation of this mechanism which can be used via the
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/service/ServerPushSession.html">ServerPushSession</a></em>
    API.
    <strong>Before</strong> starting a background task, create an instance of <em>ServerPushSession</em>
    and call
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/service/ServerPushSession.html#start--">start</a></em>.
    When the background task has completed and no longer needs the
    server push mechanism, call
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/rap/rwt/service/ServerPushSession.html#stop--">stop</a></em>.
    Example:
  </p>
<pre class="lang-java">
final ServerPushSession pushSession = new ServerPushSession();
Runnable bgRunnable = new Runnable() {
  @Override
  public void run() {
    // do some background work ...
    // schedule the UI update
    display.asyncExec( new Runnable() {
      @Override
      public void run() {
        if( !label.isDisposed() ) {
          // update the UI
          label.setText( "updated" );
          // close push session when finished
          pushSession.stop();
        }
      }
    } );
  }
};
pushSession.start();
Thread bgThread = new Thread( bgRunnable );
bgThread.setDaemon( true );
bgThread.start();
</pre>
  <p>
    A UI session may create and start any number of <em>ServerPushSession</em>s in parallel.
    The framework will keep the server push enabled as long as there are any active push sessions.
    That is, for multiple push sessions, there is only a single request needed.
  </p>
  <p>
    Note that unlike
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Display.html#asyncExec-java.lang.Runnable-">Display#asyncExec()</a></em>,
    <em><a href="../reference/api/org/eclipse/swt/widgets/Display.html#timerExec-int, java.lang.Runnable-">Display#timerExec()</a></em>,
    does <em>not</em> require an explicit <em>ServerPushSession</em>,
    as RAP creates one automatically in this case.
  </p>
