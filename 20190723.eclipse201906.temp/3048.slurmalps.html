<h1 id="top">Running and monitoring batch jobs on SLURM ALPS systems</h1>

<p>
In order to monitor target systems, which run a combination of SLURM and ALPS as batch system,
the target system configuration <b>SLURM-ALPS-Generic-Batch</b> has to be chosen. This configuration
is derived from the <b>SLURM-Generic-Batch</b> configuration. It only includes additional status
information provided by ALPS into the monitoring results of the <a href="../05monitoring.html">System Monitoring Perspective</a>.
Note that the attempt of monitoring a SLURM ALPS system by using the monitoring type <b>SLURM</b> configured
in SLURM-Generic-Batch will fail.
</p>
<p>
Running batch jobs with this target system configuration is identical to running jobs on a plain 
<a href="slurm.html">SLURM system</a>.
