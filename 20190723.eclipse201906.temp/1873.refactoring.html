	<h1>Refactoring Object Teams programs</h1>
			Significant work has been put into supporting the automated refactoring of OT/J code.
			The following refactorings take into account the Object Teams-specific 
			relationships (implicit role inheritance, team nesting, role-base bindings and method 
			bindings).
			<ul>
			<li><b>Extract Method</b></li>
			<li><b>Move Method</b></li>
			<li><b>Pull Up</b> applicable to method or field</li>
			<li><b>Push Down</b> applicable to method or field</li>
			<li><b>Rename</b> applicable to: project, source folder, package, type, method, field.<br/>
				<i>When trying to rename a team package you'll be asked to rename the team class instead.</i></li>
			</ul>
			Additionally, specific refactorings for OT/J are being developed. Currently these are implemented:
			<ul>
			<li><b>Extract Callin</b><br/>
				Extract a block of code in a given base method into a role method plus the necessary callin binding.</li>
			<li><b>Inline Callin</b><br/>
				Inverse of the above, merge a callin-bound role method into the bound base method.</li>
			<li><b>Move to Role File</b><br/>
				Move an in-line role into its own role file <a href="otjld/def/s1.html#s1.2.5"><img src="../images/ot_paragraph.png"> 1.2.5</a></li>
			</ul>
