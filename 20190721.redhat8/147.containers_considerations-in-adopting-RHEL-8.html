			A set of container images is available for Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8.0. Notable changes include:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
					Docker is not included in RHEL 8.0. For working with containers, use the <span class="strong"><strong>podman</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>buildah</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>skopeo</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>runc</strong></span> tools.
				</p><p class="simpara">
					For information on these tools and on using containers in RHEL 8, see <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/building_running_and_managing_containers/index">Building, running, and managing containers</a>.
				</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
					The <span class="strong"><strong>podman</strong></span> tool has been released as a fully supported feature.
				</p><p class="simpara">
					The <span class="strong"><strong>podman</strong></span> tool manages pods, container images, and containers on a single node. It is built on the <span class="strong"><strong>libpod</strong></span> library, which enables management of containers and groups of containers, called pods.
				</p><p class="simpara">
					To learn how to use <span class="strong"><strong>podman</strong></span>, see <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/building_running_and_managing_containers/index">Building, running, and managing containers</a>.
				</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
					In RHEL 8 GA, Red Hat Universal Base Images (UBI) are newly available. UBIs replace some of the images Red Hat previously provided, such as the standard and the minimal RHEL base images.
				</p><p class="simpara">
					Unlike older Red Hat images, UBIs are freely redistributable. This means they can be used in any environment and shared anywhere. You can use them even if you are not a Red Hat customer.
				</p><p class="simpara">
					For UBI documentation, see <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/building_running_and_managing_containers/index">Building, running, and managing containers</a>.
				</p></li><li class="listitem">
					In RHEL 8 GA, additional container images are available that provide AppStream components, for which container images are distributed with <span class="strong"><strong>Red Hat Software Collections</strong></span> in RHEL 7. All of these RHEL 8 images are based on the <code class="literal">ubi8</code> base image.
				</li><li class="listitem">
					Container images ARM for the 64-bit ARM architecture are fully supported in RHEL 8.
				</li><li class="listitem">
					The <code class="literal">rhel-tools</code> container has been removed in RHEL 8. The <code class="literal">sos</code> and <code class="literal">redhat-support-tool</code> tools are provided in the <code class="literal">support-tools</code> container. System administrators can also use this image as a base for building system tools container image.
				</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
					The support for rootless containers is available as a technology preview in RHEL 8.
				</p><p class="simpara">
					Rootless containers are containers that are created and managed by regular system users without administrative permissions.
