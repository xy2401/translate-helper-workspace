			Podman (Pod Manager) is a fully featured container engine that is a simple daemonless tool. Podman provides a Docker-CLI comparable command line that eases the transition from other container engines and allows the management of pods, containers and images. It was not originally designed to bring up an entire Linux system or manage services for such things as start-up order, dependency checking, and failed service recovery. That is the job of a full-blown initialization system like systemd.
		</p><p>
			Red Hat has become a leader in integrating containers with systemd, so that OCI and Docker-formatted containers built by Podman can be managed in the same way that other services and features are managed in a Linux system. This chapter describes how you can use the systemd initialization service to work with containers in two different ways:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
					<span class="strong"><strong>Starting Containers with systemd</strong></span>: By setting up a systemd unit file on your host computer, you can have the host automatically start, stop, check the status, and otherwise manage a container as a systemd service.
				</li><li class="listitem">
					<span class="strong"><strong>Starting services within a container using systemd</strong></span>: Many Linux services (Web servers, file servers, database servers, and so on) are already packaged for Red Hat Enterprise Linux to run as systemd services. If you are using the latest RHEL container image, you can set the RHEL container image to start the systemd service, then automatically start selected services within the container when the container starts up.
				</li></ul></div><p>
			The following two sections describe how to use systemd container in those ways.
		</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="starting_containers_with_systemd"/>Starting containers with systemd</h1></div></div></div><p>
				When you set up a container to start as a systemd service, you can define the order in which the containerized service runs, check for dependencies (like making sure another service is running, a file is available or a resource is mounted), and even have a container start by using the runc command.
			</p><p>
				This section provides an example of a container that is configured to run directly on a RHEL or RHEL Atomic Host system as a systemd service.

						Get the image you want to run on your system. For example, to use the redis service from docker.io, run the following command:
					</p><pre class="literallayout"># podman pull docker.io/redis</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						Open Selinux permission. If SELinux is enabled on your system, you must turn on the <code class="literal">container_manage_cgroup</code> boolean to run containers with systemd as shown here (see the <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3387631">Containers running systemd</a> solution for details):
					</p><pre class="literallayout"># setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup on</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						Run the image as a container, giving it a name you want to use in the systemd service file. For example, to name the running redis container redis_server, type the following:
					</p><pre class="literallayout"># podman run -d --name redis_server -p 6379:6379 redis</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						Configure the container as a systemd service by creating the unit configuration file in the <code class="literal">/etc/systemd/system/</code> directory. For example, the contents of the <code class="literal">/etc/systemd/system/redis-container.service</code> can look as follows (note that redis_server matches the name you set on the <span class="strong"><strong>podman run</strong></span> line):
					</p><pre class="literallayout">[Unit]

ExecStop=/usr/bin/podman stop -t 2 redis_server

[Install]

						After creating the unit file, to start the container automatically at boot time, type the following:
					</p><pre class="literallayout"># systemctl enable redis-container.service</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						Once the service is enabled, it will start at boot time. To start it immediately and check the status of the service, type the following:

				A package with the systemd initialization system is included in the official Red Hat Enterprise Linux Init base image named registry.redhat.io/ubi8/ubi. This means that applications created to be managed with systemd can be started and managed inside a container. A container running systemd will:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Start the /sbin/init process (the systemd service) to run as PID 1 within the container.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Start all systemd services that are installed and enabled within the container, in order of dependencies.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Allow systemd to restart services or kill zombie processes for services started within the container.
					</li></ul></div><p>
				The general steps for building a container that is ready to be used as a systemd services is:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Install the package containing the systemd-enabled service inside the container. This can include dozens of services that come with RHEL, such as Apache Web Server (httpd), FTP server (vsftpd), Proxy server (squid), and many others. For this example, we simply install an Apache (httpd) Web server.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Use the systemctl command to enable the service inside the container.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Add data for the service to use in the container (in this example, we add a Web server test page). For a real deployment, you would probably connect to outside storage.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Expose any ports needed to access the service.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Set /sbin/init as the default process to start when the container runs
					</li></ul></div><p>
				In this example, we build a container by creating a Dockerfile that installs and configures a Web server (httpd) to start automatically by the systemd service (/sbin/init) when the container is run on a host system.
			</p><div class="orderedlist"><ol class="orderedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						<span class="strong"><strong>Create Dockerfile</strong></span>: In a separate directory, create a file named Dockerfile with the following contents:
					</p><pre class="literallayout">FROM ubi8/ubi
RUN yum -y install httpd; yum clean all; systemctl enable httpd;
RUN echo "Successful Web Server Test" &gt; /var/www/html/index.html
RUN mkdir /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/; echo -e '[Service]\nRestart=always' &gt; /etc/systemd/system/httpd.service.d/httpd.conf
EXPOSE 80
CMD [ "/sbin/init" ]</pre><p class="simpara">
						The Dockerfile installs the httpd package, enables the httpd service to start at boot time (i.e. when the container starts), creates a test file (index.html), exposes the Web server to the host (port 80), and starts the systemd init service (/sbin/init) when the container starts.
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						<span class="strong"><strong>Build the container</strong></span>: From the directory containing the Dockerfile, type the following:
					</p><pre class="literallayout"># podman build --format=docker -t mysysd .</pre></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						<span class="strong"><strong>Open Selinux permission</strong></span>. If SELinux is enabled on your system, you must turn on the <code class="literal">container_manage_cgroup</code> boolean to run containers with systemd as shown here (see the <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/solutions/3387631">Containers running systemd</a> solution for details):

					</p><pre class="literallayout"># podman run -d --name=mysysd_run -p 80:80 mysysd</pre><p class="simpara">
						From this command, the mysysd image runs as the mysysd_run container as a daemon process, with port 80 from the container exposed to port 80 on the host system.
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						<span class="strong"><strong>Check that the container is running</strong></span>: To make sure that the container is running and that the service is working, type the following commands:
					</p><pre class="literallayout"># podman ps | grep mysysd_run
a282b0c2ad3d  localhost/mysysd:latest  /sbin/init  15 seconds ago  Up 14 seconds ago  0.0.0.0:80-&gt;80/tcp  mysysd_run
# curl localhost/index.html
Successful Web Server Test</pre></li></ol></div><p>
				At this point, you have a container that starts up a Web server as a systemd service inside the container. Install and run any services you like in this same way by modifying the Dockerfile and configuring data and opening ports as appropriate.
