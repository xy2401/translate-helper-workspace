			TLS (Transport Layer Security) is a cryptographic protocol used to secure network communications. When hardening system security settings by configuring preferred key-exchange protocols, authentication methods, and encryption algorithms, it is necessary to bear in mind that the broader the range of supported clients, the lower the resulting security. Conversely, strict security settings lead to limited compatibility with clients, which can result in some users being locked out of the system. Be sure to target the strictest available configuration and only relax it when it is required for compatibility reasons.

				The Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) protocol was originally developed by Netscape Corporation to provide a mechanism for secure communication over the Internet. Subsequently, the protocol was adopted by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) and renamed to Transport Layer Security (TLS).
			</p><p>
				The TLS protocol sits between an application protocol layer and a reliable transport layer, such as TCP/IP. It is independent of the application protocol and can thus be layered underneath many different protocols, for example: HTTP, FTP, SMTP, and so on.

				In RHEL 8, cryptography-related considerations are significantly simplified thanks to the system-wide crypto policies. The <code class="literal">DEFAULT</code> crypto policy allows only TLS 1.2 and 1.3. To allow your system to negotiate connections using the earlier versions of TLS, you need to either opt out from following crypto policies in an application or switch to the <code class="literal">LEGACY</code> policy with the <code class="literal">update-crypto-policies</code> command. See <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening">Using system-wide cryptographic policies</a> for more information.
			</p><p>
				The default settings provided by libraries included in RHEL 8 are secure enough for most deployments. The TLS implementations use secure algorithms where possible while not preventing connections from or to legacy clients or servers. Apply hardened settings in environments with strict security requirements where legacy clients or servers that do not support secure algorithms or protocols are not expected or allowed to connect.
			</p><p>
				The most straightforward way to harden your TLS configuration is switching the system-wide cryptographic policy level to <code class="literal">FUTURE</code> using the <code class="literal">update-crypto-policies --set FUTURE</code> command.
			</p><p>
				If you decide to not follow RHEL system-wide crypto policies, use the following recommendations for preferred protocols, cipher suites, and key lengths on your custom configuration:
			</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="protocols"/>Protocols</h2></div></div></div><p>
					The latest version of TLS provides the best security mechanism. Unless you have a compelling reason to include support for older versions of TLS, allow your systems to negotiate connections using at least TLS version 1.2. Note that despite that RHEL 8 supports TLS version 1.3, not all features of this protocol are fully supported by RHEL 8 component. For example, the 0-RTT (Zero Round Trip Time) feature, which reduces connection latency, is not yet fully supported by Apache or Nginx web servers.
				</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="cipher_suites"/>Cipher suites</h2></div></div></div><p>
					Modern, more secure cipher suites should be preferred to old, insecure ones. Always disable the use of eNULL and aNULL cipher suites, which do not offer any encryption or authentication at all. If at all possible, ciphers suites based on RC4 or HMAC-MD5, which have serious shortcomings, should also be disabled. The same applies to the so-called export cipher suites, which have been intentionally made weaker, and thus are easy to break.
				</p><p>
					While not immediately insecure, cipher suites that offer less than 128 bits of security should not be considered for their short useful life. Algorithms that use 128 bits of security or more can be expected to be unbreakable for at least several years, and are thus strongly recommended. Note that while 3DES ciphers advertise the use of 168 bits, they actually offer 112 bits of security.
				</p><p>
					Always give preference to cipher suites that support (perfect) forward secrecy (PFS), which ensures the confidentiality of encrypted data even in case the server key is compromised. This rules out the fast RSA key exchange, but allows for the use of ECDHE and DHE. Of the two, ECDHE is the faster and therefore the preferred choice.
				</p><p>
					You should also give preference to AEAD ciphers, such as AES-GCM, before CBC-mode ciphers as they are not vulnerable to padding oracle attacks. Additionally, in many cases, AES-GCM is faster than AES in CBC mode, especially when the hardware has cryptographic accelerators for AES.
				</p><p>
					Note also that when using the ECDHE key exchange with ECDSA certificates, the transaction is even faster than pure RSA key exchange. To provide support for legacy clients, you can install two pairs of certificates and keys on a server: one with ECDSA keys (for new clients) and one with RSA keys (for legacy ones).
				</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="public_key_length"/>Public key length</h2></div></div></div><p>
					When using RSA keys, always prefer key lengths of at least 3072 bits signed by at least SHA-256, which is sufficiently large for true 128 bits of security.
				</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
						The security of your system is only as strong as the weakest link in the chain. For example, a strong cipher alone does not guarantee good security. The keys and the certificates are just as important, as well as the hash functions and keys used by the Certification Authority (CA) to sign your keys.

				In Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8, <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html/security_hardening/using-the-system-wide-cryptographic-policies_security-hardening">system-wide crypto policies</a> provide a convenient way to ensure that your applications using cryptographic libraries do not allow known insecure protocols, ciphers, or algorithms.
			</p><p>
				If you want to harden your TLS-related configuration with your customized cryptographic settings, you can use the cryptographic configuration options described in this section, and override the system-wide crypto policies just in the minimum required amount.
			</p><p>
				Regardless of the configuration you choose to use, always make sure to mandate that your server application enforces <span class="emphasis"><em>server-side cipher order</em></span>, so that the cipher suite to be used is determined by the order you configure.

					The <code class="literal">Apache HTTP Server</code> can use both <code class="literal">OpenSSL</code> and <code class="literal">NSS</code> libraries for its TLS needs. Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 provides the <code class="literal">mod_ssl</code> functionality through eponymous packages:
				</p><pre class="screen"># yum install mod_ssl</pre><p>
					The <code class="literal">mod_ssl</code> package installs the <code class="literal">/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf</code> configuration file, which can be used to modify the TLS-related settings of the <code class="literal">Apache HTTP Server</code>.
				</p><p>
					Install the <code class="literal">httpd-manual</code> package to obtain complete documentation for the <code class="literal">Apache HTTP Server</code>, including TLS configuration. The directives available in the <code class="literal">/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf</code> configuration file are described in detail in <a class="link" href="file:///usr/share/httpd/manual/mod/mod_ssl.html">/usr/share/httpd/manual/mod/mod_ssl.html</a>. Examples of various settings are in <a class="link" href="file:///usr/share/httpd/manual/ssl/ssl_howto.html">/usr/share/httpd/manual/ssl/ssl_howto.html</a>.
				</p><p>
					When modifying the settings in the <code class="literal">/etc/httpd/conf.d/ssl.conf</code> configuration file, be sure to consider the following three directives at the minimum:
				</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">SSLProtocol</code></span></dt><dd>
								Use this directive to specify the version of TLS or SSL you want to allow.

								Uncomment and set this directive to <code class="literal">on</code> to ensure that the connecting clients adhere to the order of ciphers you specified.
							</dd></dl></div><p>
					For example, to use only the TLS 1.2 and 1.3 protocol:

					To configure your installation of the <code class="literal">Dovecot</code> mail server to use TLS, modify the <code class="literal">/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf</code> configuration file. You can find an explanation of some of the basic configuration directives available in that file in the <a class="link" href="/usr/share/doc/dovecot/wiki/SSL.DovecotConfiguration.txt">/usr/share/doc/dovecot/wiki/SSL.DovecotConfiguration.txt</a> file, which is installed along with the standard installation of <code class="literal">Dovecot</code>.
				</p><p>
					When modifying the settings in the <code class="literal">/etc/dovecot/conf.d/10-ssl.conf</code> configuration file, be sure to consider the following three directives at the minimum:
				</p><div class="variablelist"><dl class="variablelist"><dt><span class="term"><code class="literal">ssl_protocols</code></span></dt><dd>
								Use this directive to specify the version of TLS or SSL you want to allow or disable.
