			If you are unfamiliar with the concept of virtualization or its implementation in Linux, the following sections provide a general overview of virtualization in RHEL 8: its basics, advantages, components, and other possible virtualization solutions provided by Red Hat.
		</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="what-is-virtualization-in-rhel-8-virt-overview"/>What is virtualization in RHEL 8?</h1></div></div></div><p>
				Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 (RHEL 8) provides the <span class="emphasis"><em>virtualization</em></span> functionality. This means that with the help of virtualization software, a machine running RHEL 8 can <span class="emphasis"><em>host</em></span> multiple virtual machines (VMs), also referred to as <span class="emphasis"><em>guests</em></span>. Guests use the host’s physical hardware and computing resources to run a separate, virtualized operating system (<span class="emphasis"><em>guest OS</em></span>) as a user-space process on the host’s operating system.
			</p><p>
				In other words, virtualization makes it possible to have operating systems within operating systems.
			</p><p>
				VMs enable you to safely test software configurations and features, run legacy software, or optimize the workload efficiency of your hardware. For more information on the benefits, see <a class="xref" href="virtualization-in-rhel-8-an-overview_configuring-and-managing-virtualization.html#advantages-of-virtualization_virt-overview" title="Advantages of virtualization">the section called “Advantages of virtualization”</a>.

					In addition to RHEL 8 virtualization, Red Hat offers a number of specialized virtualization solutions, each with a different user focus and features.

				Using virtual machines (VMs) has the following benefits in comparison to using physical machines:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						<span class="strong"><strong>Flexible and fine-grained allocation of resources</strong></span>
					</p><p class="simpara">
						A VM runs on a host machine, which is usually physical, and physical hardware can also be assigned for the guest OS to use. However, the allocation of physical resources to the VM is done in software, and is therefore very flexible. A VM uses a configurable fraction of the host memory, CPUs, or storage space, and that configuration can specify very fine-grained resource requests.
					</p><p class="simpara">
						For example, what the guest OS sees as its disk can be represented as a file on the host file system, and the size of that disk is much less constrained than the available sizes for physical disks.
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						<span class="strong"><strong>Software-controlled configurations</strong></span>
					</p><p class="simpara">
						All of a VM’s configuration is saved as data on the host, and under software control. Therefore, a VM can easily be created, removed, cloned, migrated, operated remotely, or connected to remote storage.
					</p><p class="simpara">
						In addition, the current state of the VM can be backed up as a snapshot at any time. A snapshot can then be loaded to restore the system to the saved state.
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						<span class="strong"><strong>Separation from the host</strong></span>
					</p><p class="simpara">
						A guest runs on a virtualized kernel, separate from the host OS. This means that any OS can be installed on a VM, and that even if the guest OS becomes unstable or is compromised, the host is not affected in any way.
					</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
							Not all operating systems are supported as a guest OS in a RHEL 8 host. For details, see <a class="xref" href="feature-support-and-limitations-in-rhel8-virtualization_configuring-and-managing-virtualization.html#recommended-features-in-rhel8-virtualization_feature-support-and-limitations-in-rhel8-virtualization" title="Recommended features in RHEL 8 virtualization">the section called “Recommended features in RHEL 8 virtualization”</a>.
						</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						<span class="strong"><strong>Space and cost efficiency</strong></span>
					</p><p class="simpara">
						A single physical machine can host a large number of VMs. Therefore, it avoids the need for multiple physical machines to do the same tasks, and thus lowers the space, power, and maintenance requirements associated with physical hardware.

				Virtualization in RHEL 8 consists of the following principal software components:
			</p><h3><a id="hypervisor"/>Hypervisor</h3><p>
				The basis of creating virtual machines (VMs) in RHEL 8 is the <span class="emphasis"><em>hypervisor</em></span>, a software layer that controls hardware and enables running multiple operating systems on a host machine.
			</p><p>
				The hypervisor includes the <span class="strong"><strong>Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM)</strong></span> kernel module and virtualization kernel drivers, such as <code class="literal">virtio</code> and <code class="literal">vfio</code>. These components ensure that the Linux kernel on the host machine provides resources for virtualization to user-space software.
			</p><p>
				At the user-space level, the <span class="strong"><strong>QEMU</strong></span> emulator simulates a complete virtualized hardware platform that the guest operating system can run in, and manages how resources are allocated on the host and presented to the guest.
			</p><p>
				In addition, the <code class="literal">libvirt</code> software suite serves as a management and communication layer, making QEMU easier to interact with, enforcing security rules, and providing a number of additional tools for configuring and running guests.
			</p><h3><a id="xml_configuration"/>XML configuration</h3><p>
				A host-based XML configuration file (also known as a <span class="emphasis"><em>domain XML</em></span> file) describes a specific VM. It includes:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Metadata such as the name of the VM, time zone, and other information about the VM.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						A description of the devices in the VM, including virtual CPUs (vCPUS), storage devices, input/output devices, network interface cards, and other hardware, real and virtual.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						VM settings such as the maximum amount of memory it can use, restart settings, and other settings about the behavior of the VM.
					</li></ul></div><h3><a id="component_interaction"/>Component interaction</h3><p>
				When a VM is started, the hypervisor creates an instance of the VM as a user-space process on the host based on the XML configuration. The hypervisor also makes the VM process accessible to the host-based interfaces, such as the <code class="literal">virsh</code>, <code class="literal">virt-install</code>, and <code class="literal">guestfish</code> commands, or the web console GUI.
			</p><p>
				When these virtualization tools are used, libvirt translates their input into instructions for QEMU. QEMU communicates the instructions to KVM, which ensures that the kernel appropriately assigns the resources necessary to carry out the instructions. As a result, QEMU can execute the corresponding user-space changes, such as creating or modifying a guest, or performing an action in the guest’s operating system.
			</p><div class="note" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Note</h3><p>
					While QEMU is an essential component of the architecture, it is not intended to be used directly on RHEL 8 systems, due to security concerns. Therefore, using <code class="literal">qemu-*</code> commands is not supported by Red Hat, and it is highly recommended to interact with QEMU using libvirt.

				You can manage virtualization in RHEL 8 using the command-line interface (CLI) or several graphical user interface (GUIs).
			</p><h3><a id="command_line_interface"/>Command-line interface</h3><p>
				The CLI is the most powerful method of managing virtualization in RHEL 8. Prominent CLI commands for virtualization management include:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						<span class="strong"><strong>virsh</strong></span> - A versatile virtualization command-line utility and shell with a great variety of purposes, depending on the provided arguments. For example:

							</li><li class="listitem">
								Entering a virtualization shell - <code class="literal">virsh</code>
							</li></ul></div><p class="simpara">
						For more information, see the <code class="literal">virsh(1)</code> man page.
					</p></li><li class="listitem">
						<code class="literal">virt-install</code> - A CLI utility for creating new virtual machines. For more information, see the <code class="literal">virt-install(1)</code> man page.

			</p><h3><a id="graphical_interfaces"/>Graphical interfaces</h3><p>
				You can use the following GUIs to manage virtualization in RHEL 8:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						The <span class="strong"><strong>RHEL 8 web console</strong></span>, also known as <span class="emphasis"><em>Cockpit</em></span>, provides a remotely accessible and easy to use graphical user interface for managing VMs and virtualization hosts.
					</p><p class="simpara">

							Although still supported in RHEL 8, <span class="strong"><strong>virt-manager</strong></span> has been deprecated. The RHEL 8 web console is intended to become its replacement in a subsequent release. It is, therefore, recommended that you get familiar with the web console for managing virtualization in a GUI. However, in RHEL 8, some features may only be accessible from either <span class="strong"><strong>virt-manager</strong></span> or the command line.
						</p></div></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						The <span class="strong"><strong>Gnome Boxes</strong></span> application is a lightweight graphical interface to view and access VMs and remote systems. Gnome Boxes is primarily designed for use on desktop systems.
