			Due to the increased reliance on powerful, networked computers to help run businesses and keep track of our personal information, entire industries have been formed around the practice of network and computer security. Enterprises have solicited the knowledge and skills of security experts to properly audit systems and tailor solutions to fit the operating requirements of their organization. Because most organizations are increasingly dynamic in nature, their workers are accessing critical company IT resources locally and remotely, hence the need for secure computing environments has become more pronounced.
		</p><p>
			Unfortunately, many organizations, as well as individual users, regard security as more of an afterthought, a process that is overlooked in favor of increased power, productivity, convenience, ease of use, and budgetary concerns. Proper security implementation is often enacted postmortem — after an unauthorized intrusion has already occurred. Taking the correct measures prior to connecting a site to an untrusted network, such as the Internet, is an effective means of thwarting many attempts at intrusion.

				Computer security is a general term that covers a wide area of computing and information processing. Industries that depend on computer systems and networks to conduct daily business transactions and access critical information regard their data as an important part of their overall assets. Several terms and metrics have entered our daily business vocabulary, such as total cost of ownership (TCO), return on investment (ROI), and quality of service (QoS). Using these metrics, industries can calculate aspects such as data integrity and high-availability (HA) as part of their planning and process management costs. In some industries, such as electronic commerce, the availability and trustworthiness of data can mean the difference between success and failure.

				Enterprises in every industry rely on regulations and rules that are set by standards-making bodies such as the American Medical Association (AMA) or the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE). The same concepts hold true for information security. Many security consultants and vendors agree upon the standard security model known as CIA, or <span class="emphasis"><em>Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability</em></span>. This three-tiered model is a generally accepted component to assessing risks of sensitive information and establishing security policy. The following describes the CIA model in further detail:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Confidentiality — Sensitive information must be available only to a set of pre-defined individuals. Unauthorized transmission and usage of information should be restricted. For example, confidentiality of information ensures that a customer’s personal or financial information is not obtained by an unauthorized individual for malicious purposes such as identity theft or credit fraud.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Integrity — Information should not be altered in ways that render it incomplete or incorrect. Unauthorized users should be restricted from the ability to modify or destroy sensitive information.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Availability — Information should be accessible to authorized users any time that it is needed. Availability is a warranty that information can be obtained with an agreed-upon frequency and timeliness. This is often measured in terms of percentages and agreed to formally in Service Level Agreements (SLAs) used by network service providers and their enterprise clients.
					</li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="cryptographic-software-and-certifications_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Cryptographic software and certifications</h1></div></div></div><p>
				Red Hat Enterprise Linux undergoes several security certifications, such as <span class="strong"><strong>FIPS 140-2</strong></span> or <span class="strong"><strong>Common Criteria</strong></span> (CC), to ensure that industry best practices are followed.
			</p><p>
				The <span class="strong"><strong><a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/articles/3655361">RHEL 8 core crypto components</a></strong></span> Knowledgebase article provides an overview of the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 core crypto components, documenting which are they, how are they selected, how are they integrated into the operating system, how do they support hardware security modules and smart cards, and how do crypto certifications apply to them.
			</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="Security_Controls_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Security controls</h1></div></div></div><p>
				Computer security is often divided into three distinct master categories, commonly referred to as <code class="literal">controls</code>:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Physical
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Technical
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Administrative
					</li></ul></div><p>
				These three broad categories define the main objectives of proper security implementation. Within these controls are sub-categories that further detail the controls and how to implement them.
			</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Physical_Controls_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Physical controls</h2></div></div></div><p>
					Physical control is the implementation of security measures in a defined structure used to deter or prevent unauthorized access to sensitive material. Examples of physical controls are:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							Closed-circuit surveillance cameras
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Motion or thermal alarm systems
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Security guards
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Picture IDs
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Locked and dead-bolted steel doors
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Biometrics (includes fingerprint, voice, face, iris, handwriting, and other automated methods used to recognize individuals)
						</li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Technical_Controls_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Technical controls</h2></div></div></div><p>
					Technical controls use technology as a basis for controlling the access and usage of sensitive data throughout a physical structure and over a network. Technical controls are far-reaching in scope and encompass such technologies as:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							Encryption
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Smart cards
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Network authentication

							Access control lists (ACLs)
						</li><li class="listitem">
							File integrity auditing software
						</li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="Administrative_Controls_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Administrative controls</h2></div></div></div><p>
					Administrative controls define the human factors of security. They involve all levels of personnel within an organization and determine which users have access to what resources and information by such means as:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							Training and awareness
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Disaster preparedness and recovery plans
						</li><li class="listitem">

						</li></ul></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="vulnerability-assessment_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Vulnerability assessment</h1></div></div></div><p>
				Given time, resources, and motivation, an attacker can break into nearly any system. All of the security procedures and technologies currently available cannot guarantee that any systems are completely safe from intrusion. Routers help secure gateways to the Internet. Firewalls help secure the edge of the network. Virtual Private Networks safely pass data in an encrypted stream. Intrusion detection systems warn you of malicious activity. However, the success of each of these technologies is dependent upon a number of variables, including:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						The expertise of the staff responsible for configuring, monitoring, and maintaining the technologies.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						The ability to patch and update services and kernels quickly and efficiently.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						The ability of those responsible to keep constant vigilance over the network.
					</li></ul></div><p>
				Given the dynamic state of data systems and technologies, securing corporate resources can be quite complex. Due to this complexity, it is often difficult to find expert resources for all of your systems. While it is possible to have personnel knowledgeable in many areas of information security at a high level, it is difficult to retain staff who are experts in more than a few subject areas. This is mainly because each subject area of information security requires constant attention and focus. Information security does not stand still.
			</p><p>
				A vulnerability assessment is an internal audit of your network and system security; the results of which indicate the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of your network. Typically, vulnerability assessment starts with a reconnaissance phase, during which important data regarding the target systems and resources is gathered. This phase leads to the system readiness phase, whereby the target is essentially checked for all known vulnerabilities. The readiness phase culminates in the reporting phase, where the findings are classified into categories of high, medium, and low risk; and methods for improving the security (or mitigating the risk of vulnerability) of the target are discussed
			</p><p>
				If you were to perform a vulnerability assessment of your home, you would likely check each door to your home to see if they are closed and locked. You would also check every window, making sure that they closed completely and latch correctly. This same concept applies to systems, networks, and electronic data. Malicious users are the thieves and vandals of your data. Focus on their tools, mentality, and motivations, and you can then react swiftly to their actions.
			</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="defining-assessment-and-testing_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Defining assessment and testing</h2></div></div></div><p>
					Vulnerability assessments may be broken down into one of two types: <span class="emphasis"><em>outside looking in</em></span> and <span class="emphasis"><em>inside looking around</em></span>.
				</p><p>
					When performing an outside-looking-in vulnerability assessment, you are attempting to compromise your systems from the outside. Being external to your company provides you with the cracker’s point of view. You see what a cracker sees — publicly-routable IP addresses, systems on your <span class="emphasis"><em>DMZ</em></span>, external interfaces of your firewall, and more. DMZ stands for "demilitarized zone", which corresponds to a computer or small subnetwork that sits between a trusted internal network, such as a corporate private LAN, and an untrusted external network, such as the public Internet. Typically, the DMZ contains devices accessible to Internet traffic, such as web (HTTP) servers, FTP servers, SMTP (e-mail) servers and DNS servers.
				</p><p>
					When you perform an inside-looking-around vulnerability assessment, you are at an advantage since you are internal and your status is elevated to trusted. This is the point of view you and your co-workers have once logged on to your systems. You see print servers, file servers, databases, and other resources.
				</p><p>
					There are striking distinctions between the two types of vulnerability assessments. Being internal to your company gives you more privileges than an outsider. In most organizations, security is configured to keep intruders out. Very little is done to secure the internals of the organization (such as departmental firewalls, user-level access controls, and authentication procedures for internal resources). Typically, there are many more resources when looking around inside as most systems are internal to a company. Once you are outside the company, your status is untrusted. The systems and resources available to you externally are usually very limited.
				</p><p>
					Consider the difference between vulnerability assessments and <span class="emphasis"><em>penetration tests</em></span>. Think of a vulnerability assessment as the first step to a penetration test. The information gleaned from the assessment is used for testing. Whereas the assessment is undertaken to check for holes and potential vulnerabilities, the penetration testing actually attempts to exploit the findings.
				</p><p>
					Assessing network infrastructure is a dynamic process. Security, both information and physical, is dynamic. Performing an assessment shows an overview, which can turn up false positives and false negatives. A false positive is a result, where the tool finds vulnerabilities which in reality do not exist. A false negative is when it omits actual vulnerabilities.
				</p><p>
					Security administrators are only as good as the tools they use and the knowledge they retain. Take any of the assessment tools currently available, run them against your system, and it is almost a guarantee that there are some false positives. Whether by program fault or user error, the result is the same. The tool may find false positives, or, even worse, false negatives.
				</p><p>
					Now that the difference between a vulnerability assessment and a penetration test is defined, take the findings of the assessment and review them carefully before conducting a penetration test as part of your new best practices approach.
				</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>

					To aid in the selection of tools for a vulnerability assessment, it is helpful to establish a vulnerability assessment methodology. Unfortunately, there is no predefined or industry approved methodology at this time; however, common sense and best practices can act as a sufficient guide.
				</p><p>
					<span class="emphasis"><em>What is the target? Are we looking at one server, or are we looking at our entire network and everything within the network? Are we external or internal to the company?</em></span> The answers to these questions are important as they help determine not only which tools to select but also the manner in which they are used.
				</p><p>
					To learn more about establishing methodologies, see the following website:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							<a class="link" href="https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page">https://www.owasp.org/</a> — <span class="strong"><strong><span class="citetitle">The Open Web Application Security Project</span></strong></span>
						</li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="vulnerability-assessment-tools_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Vulnerability assessment tools</h2></div></div></div><p>
					An assessment can start by using some form of an information-gathering tool. When assessing the entire network, map the layout first to find the hosts that are running. Once located, examine each host individually. Focusing on these hosts requires another set of tools. Knowing which tools to use may be the most crucial step in finding vulnerabilities.
				</p><p>
					The following tools are just a small sampling of the available tools:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							<code class="literal">Nmap</code> is a popular tool that can be used to find host systems and open ports on those systems.

					Bad practices when configuring the following aspects of a network can increase the risk of an attack.
				</p><div class="title"><strong>Insecure architectures</strong></div><p>
						A misconfigured network is a primary entry point for unauthorized users. Leaving a trust-based, open local network vulnerable to the highly-insecure Internet is much like leaving a door ajar in a crime-ridden neighborhood — nothing may happen for an arbitrary amount of time, but someone exploits the opportunity <span class="emphasis"><em>eventually</em></span>.
					</p><div class="title"><strong>Broadcast networks</strong></div><p>
						System administrators often fail to realize the importance of networking hardware in their security schemes. Simple hardware, such as hubs and routers, relies on the broadcast or non-switched principle; that is, whenever a node transmits data across the network to a recipient node, the hub or router sends a broadcast of the data packets until the recipient node receives and processes the data. This method is the most vulnerable to address resolution protocol (<span class="emphasis"><em>ARP</em></span>) or media access control (<span class="emphasis"><em>MAC</em></span>) address spoofing by both outside intruders and unauthorized users on local hosts.
					</p><div class="title"><strong>Centralized servers</strong></div><p>
						Another potential networking pitfall is the use of centralized computing. A common cost-cutting measure for many businesses is to consolidate all services to a single powerful machine. This can be convenient as it is easier to manage and costs considerably less than multiple-server configurations. However, a centralized server introduces a single point of failure on the network. If the central server is compromised, it may render the network completely useless or worse, prone to data manipulation or theft. In these situations, a central server becomes an open door that allows access to the entire network.
					</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="threats-to-server-security_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Threats to server security</h2></div></div></div><p>
					Server security is as important as network security because servers often hold a great deal of an organization’s vital information. If a server is compromised, all of its contents may become available for the cracker to steal or manipulate at will. The following sections detail some of the main issues.
				</p><div class="title"><strong>Unused services and open ports</strong></div><p>
						A full installation of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 contains more than 1000 applications and library packages. However, most server administrators do not opt to install every single package in the distribution, preferring instead to install a base installation of packages, including several server applications.
					</p><p>
					A common occurrence among system administrators is to install the operating system without paying attention to what programs are actually being installed. This can be problematic because unneeded services may be installed, configured with the default settings, and possibly turned on. This can cause unwanted services, such as Telnet, DHCP, or DNS, to run on a server or workstation without the administrator realizing it, which in turn can cause unwanted traffic to the server or even a potential pathway into the system for crackers.
				</p><div class="title"><strong>Unpatched services</strong></div><p>
						Most server applications that are included in a default installation are solid, thoroughly tested pieces of software. Having been in use in production environments for many years, their code has been thoroughly refined and many of the bugs have been found and fixed.
					</p><p>
					However, there is no such thing as perfect software and there is always room for further refinement. Moreover, newer software is often not as rigorously tested as one might expect, because of its recent arrival to production environments or because it may not be as popular as other server software.
				</p><p>
					Developers and system administrators often find exploitable bugs in server applications and publish the information on bug tracking and security-related websites such as the Bugtraq mailing list (<a class="link" href="http://www.securityfocus.com">http://www.securityfocus.com</a>) or the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) website (<a class="link" href="http://www.cert.org">http://www.cert.org</a>). Although these mechanisms are an effective way of alerting the community to security vulnerabilities, it is up to system administrators to patch their systems promptly. This is particularly true because crackers have access to these same vulnerability tracking services and will use the information to crack unpatched systems whenever they can. Good system administration requires vigilance, constant bug tracking, and proper system maintenance to ensure a more secure computing environment.
				</p><div class="title"><strong>Inattentive administration</strong></div><p>
						Administrators who fail to patch their systems are one of the greatest threats to server security. This applies as much to inexperienced administrators as it does to overconfident or amotivated administrators.
					</p><p>
					Some administrators fail to patch their servers and workstations, while others fail to watch log messages from the system kernel or network traffic. Another common error is when default passwords or keys to services are left unchanged. For example, some databases have default administration passwords because the database developers assume that the system administrator changes these passwords immediately after installation. If a database administrator fails to change this password, even an inexperienced cracker can use a widely-known default password to gain administrative privileges to the database. These are only a few examples of how inattentive administration can lead to compromised servers.
				</p><div class="title"><strong>Inherently insecure services</strong></div><p>
						Even the most vigilant organization can fall victim to vulnerabilities if the network services they choose are inherently insecure. For instance, there are many services developed under the assumption that they are used over trusted networks; however, this assumption fails as soon as the service becomes available over the Internet — which is itself inherently untrusted.
					</p><p>
					One category of insecure network services are those that require unencrypted user names and passwords for authentication. Telnet and FTP are two such services. If packet sniffing software is monitoring traffic between the remote user and such a service user names and passwords can be easily intercepted.
				</p><p>
					Inherently, such services can also more easily fall prey to what the security industry terms the <span class="emphasis"><em>man-in-the-middle</em></span> attack. In this type of attack, a cracker redirects network traffic by tricking a cracked name server on the network to point to his machine instead of the intended server. Once someone opens a remote session to the server, the attacker’s machine acts as an invisible conduit, sitting quietly between the remote service and the unsuspecting user capturing information. In this way a cracker can gather administrative passwords and raw data without the server or the user realizing it.
				</p><p>
					Another category of insecure services include network file systems and information services such as NFS or NIS, which are developed explicitly for LAN usage but are, unfortunately, extended to include WANs (for remote users). NFS does not, by default, have any authentication or security mechanisms configured to prevent a cracker from mounting the NFS share and accessing anything contained therein. NIS, as well, has vital information that must be known by every computer on a network, including passwords and file permissions, within a plain text ASCII or DBM (ASCII-derived) database. A cracker who gains access to this database can then access every user account on a network, including the administrator’s account.
				</p><p>
					By default, Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 is released with all such services turned off. However, since administrators often find themselves forced to use these services, careful configuration is critical.
				</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="threats-to-workstation-and-home-pc-security_overview-of-security-hardening"/>Threats to workstation and home PC security</h2></div></div></div><p>
					Workstations and home PCs may not be as prone to attack as networks or servers, but since they often contain sensitive data, such as credit card information, they are targeted by system crackers. Workstations can also be co-opted without the user’s knowledge and used by attackers as "slave" machines in coordinated attacks. For these reasons, knowing the vulnerabilities of a workstation can save users the headache of reinstalling the operating system, or worse, recovering from data theft.
				</p><div class="title"><strong>Bad passwords</strong></div><p>
						Bad passwords are one of the easiest ways for an attacker to gain access to a system.
					</p><div class="title"><strong>Vulnerable client applications</strong></div><p>
						Although an administrator may have a fully secure and patched server, that does not mean remote users are secure when accessing it. For instance, if the server offers Telnet or FTP services over a public network, an attacker can capture the plain text user names and passwords as they pass over the network, and then use the account information to access the remote user’s workstation.
					</p><p>
					Even when using secure protocols, such as SSH, a remote user may be vulnerable to certain attacks if they do not keep their client applications updated. For instance, SSH protocol version 1 clients are vulnerable to an X-forwarding attack from malicious SSH servers. Once connected to the server, the attacker can quietly capture any keystrokes and mouse clicks made by the client over the network. This problem was fixed in the SSH version 2 protocol, but it is up to the user to keep track of what applications have such vulnerabilities and update them as necessary.

								Remote attacker must have access to a compromised system on a LAN in order to perform such an attack; usually the cracker has used an active attack (such as IP spoofing or man-in-the-middle) to compromise a system on the LAN.

								Preventative measures include services with cryptographic key exchange, one-time passwords, or encrypted authentication to prevent password snooping; strong encryption during transmission is also advised.

								Service vulnerabilities
							</p>
							 </td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"> <p>
								An attacker finds a flaw or loophole in a service run over the Internet; through this vulnerability, the attacker compromises the entire system and any data that it may hold, and could possibly compromise other systems on the network.
							</p>
							 </td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"> <p>
								HTTP-based services such as CGI are vulnerable to remote command execution and even interactive shell access. Even if the HTTP service runs as a non-privileged user such as "nobody", information such as configuration files and network maps can be read, or the attacker can start a denial of service attack which drains system resources or renders it unavailable to other users.
							</p>
							 <p>

							</p>
							 <p>
								Services sometimes can have vulnerabilities that go unnoticed during development and testing; these vulnerabilities (such as <span class="emphasis"><em>buffer overflows</em></span>, where attackers crash a service using arbitrary values that fill the memory buffer of an application, giving the attacker an interactive command prompt from which they may execute arbitrary commands) can give complete administrative control to an attacker.
							</p>
							 <p>

							</p>
							 <p>
								Administrators should make sure that services do not run as the root user, and should stay vigilant of patches and errata updates for applications from vendors or security organizations such as CERT and CVE.

								Attackers find faults in desktop and workstation applications (such as email clients) and execute arbitrary code, implant Trojan horses for future compromise, or crash systems. Further exploitation can occur if the compromised workstation has administrative privileges on the rest of the network.
							</p>
							 </td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"> <p>
								Workstations and desktops are more prone to exploitation as workers do not have the expertise or experience to prevent or detect a compromise; it is imperative to inform individuals of the risks they are taking when they install unauthorized software or open unsolicited email attachments.
							</p>
							 <p>

							</p>
							 <p>
								Safeguards can be implemented such that email client software does not automatically open or execute attachments. Additionally, the automatic update of workstation software using Red Hat Network; or other system management services can alleviate the burdens of multi-seat security deployments.

								Denial of Service (DoS) attacks
							</p>
							 </td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"> <p>
								Attacker or group of attackers coordinate against an organization’s network or server resources by sending unauthorized packets to the target host (either server, router, or workstation). This forces the resource to become unavailable to legitimate users.
							</p>
							 </td><td style="text-align: left" valign="top"> <p>
								The most reported DoS case in the US occurred in 2000. Several highly-trafficked commercial and government sites were rendered unavailable by a coordinated ping flood attack using several compromised systems with high bandwidth connections acting as <span class="emphasis"><em>zombies</em></span>, or redirected broadcast nodes.
							</p>
							 <p>

							</p>
							 <p>
								Source packets are usually forged (as well as rebroadcast), making investigation as to the true source of the attack difficult.
							</p>
							 <p>

							</p>
							 <p>
								Advances in ingress filtering (IETF rfc2267) using <code class="literal">iptables</code> and Network Intrusion Detection Systems such as <code class="literal">snort</code> assist administrators in tracking down and preventing distributed DoS attacks.
