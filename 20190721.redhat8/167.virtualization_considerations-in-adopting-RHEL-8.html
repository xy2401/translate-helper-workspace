				The Virtual Machines page can now be added to the RHEL 8 web console interface, which enables the user to create and manage libvirt-based virtual machines (VMs).
			</p><p>
				In addition, the Virtual Machine Manager (<code class="literal">virt-manager</code>) application has been deprecated, and may become unsupported in a future major release of RHEL.
			</p><p>
				Note, however, that the web console currently does not provide all of the virtual management features that `virt-manager`does. Notably:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						To create a new VM, you can only use a fresh installation. It is not possible to import VM images.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						When creating a new VM, you cannot select a specific storage pool.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Storage pools can only be created, not deleted, deactivated, or modified.
					</li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="The-q35-machine-type-is-now-supported-by-virtualization_virtualization"/>The Q35 machine type is now supported by virtualization</h1></div></div></div><p>
				Red hat Enterprise Linux 8 introduces the support for <code class="literal">Q35</code>, a more modern PCI Express-based machine type. This provides a variety of improvements in features and performance of virtual devices, and ensures that a wider range of modern devices are compatible with virtualization. In addition, virtual machines created in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 are set to use Q35 by default.
			</p><p>
				Note that the previously default <code class="literal">PC</code> machine type has become deprecated and may become unsupported in a future major release of RHEL. However, changing the machine type of existing VMs from <code class="literal">PC</code> to <code class="literal">Q35</code> is not recommended.
			</p><p>
				Notable differences between <code class="literal">PC</code> and <code class="literal">Q35</code> include:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Older operating systems, such as Windows XP, do not support Q35 and will not boot if used on a Q35 VM.
					</li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						Currently, when using RHEL 6 as the operating system on a Q35 VM, hot-plugging a PCI device to that VM in some cases does not work. In addition, certain legacy virtio devices do not work properly on RHEL 6 Q35 VMs.
					</p><p class="simpara">
						Therefore, using the PC machine type is recommended for RHEL 6 VMs.
					</p></li><li class="listitem">
						Q35 emulates PCI Express (PCI-e) buses instead of PCI. As a result, a different device topology and addressing scheme is presented to the guest OS.
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Q35 has a built-in SATA/AHCI controller, instead of an IDE controller.
					</li></ul></div><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						The SecureBoot feature only works on Q35 VMs.
					</li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="Removed-virtualization-functionality_virtualization"/>Removed virtualization functionality</h1></div></div></div><h3><a id="ivshmem_has_been_disabled"/>IVSHMEM has been disabled</h3><p>
				The inter-VM shared memory device (IVSHMEM) feature, which provides shared memory between multiple virtual machines, is now disabled in Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8. A virtual machine configured with this device will fail to boot. Similarly, attempting to hot-plug such a device device will fail as well.
			</p><h3><a id="literal_virt_install_literal_can_no_longer_use_nfs_locations"/><code class="literal">virt-install</code> can no longer use NFS locations</h3><p>
				With this update, the <code class="literal">virt-install</code> utility cannot mount NFS locations. As a consequence, attempting to install a virtual machine using <code class="literal">virt-install</code> with a NFS address as a value of the <code class="literal">--location</code> option fails. To work around this change, mount your NFS share prior to using <code class="literal">virt-install</code>, or use a HTTP location.
			</p><h3><a id="rhel_8_does_not_support_the_tulip_driver"/>RHEL 8 does not support the tulip driver</h3><p>
				With this update, the tulip network driver is no longer supported. As a consequence, when using RHEL 8 on a Generation 1 virtual machine (VM) on the Microsoft Hyper-V hypervisor, the "Legacy Network Adapter" device does not work, which causes PXE installation of such VMs to fail.
			</p><p>
				For the PXE installation to work, install RHEL 8 on a Generation 2 Hyper-V VM. If you require a RHEL 8 Generation 1 VM, use ISO installation.
			</p><h3><a id="lsi_logic_sas_and_parallel_scsi_drivers_are_not_supported"/>LSI Logic SAS and Parallel SCSI drivers are not supported</h3><p>
				The LSI Logic SAS driver (<code class="literal">mptsas</code>) and LSI Logic Parallel driver (<code class="literal">mptspi</code>) for SCSI are no longer supported. As a consequence, the drivers can be used for installing RHEL 8 as a guest operating system on a VMWare hypervisor to a SCSI disk, but the created VM will not be supported by Red Hat.
