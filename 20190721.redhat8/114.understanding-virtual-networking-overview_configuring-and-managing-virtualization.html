			The connection of virtual machines to other devices and locations on a network has to be facilitated by the host hardware.
		</p><p>
			Virtual networking uses the concept of a virtual network switch. A virtual network switch is a software construct that operates on a host physical machine server. Virtual machines (guests) connect to the network through the virtual network switch.
		</p><p>
			The following figure shows a virtual network switch connecting two virtual machines to the network:
		</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/vn-02-switchandtwoguests.png" alt="vn 02 switchandtwoguests"/></div></div><p>
			From the perspective of a guest operating system, a virtual network connection is the same as a physical network connection.
		</p><p>
			Host physical machine servers view virtual network switches as network interfaces. When the libvirtd daemon (<span class="strong"><strong>libvirtd</strong></span>) is first installed and started, the default network interface representing the virtual network switch is <span class="strong"><strong>virbr0</strong></span>.
		</p><p>
			This interface can be viewed with the <code class="literal">ip</code> command like any other network interface.
		</p><pre class="literallayout">$ <span class="strong"><strong>ip addr show virbr0</strong></span>
3: virbr0: &lt;BROADCAST,MULTICAST,UP,LOWER_UP&gt; mtu 1500 qdisc noqueue state

			By default, all guests on a single host are connected to the same <code class="literal">libvirt</code> virtual network, named <span class="strong"><strong>default</strong></span>. Guests on this network can make the following connections:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
					<span class="strong"><strong>With each other and with the virtualization host</strong></span>
				</p><p class="simpara">
					Both inbound and outbound traffic is possible, but is affected by the firewalls in the guest operating system’s network stack and by <code class="literal">libvirt</code> network filtering rules attached to the guest interface.
				</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
					<span class="strong"><strong>With other hosts on the network beyond the virtualization host</strong></span>
				</p><p class="simpara">
					Only outbound traffic is possible and is affected by Network Address Translation (NAT) rules, as well as the host system’s firewall.
				</p></li></ul></div><p>
			For basic outbound-only network access from virtual machines, no additional network setup is usually needed, because the default network is installed along with the <code class="literal">libvirt</code> package, and automatically started when the <code class="literal">libvirtd</code> service is started.
		</p><p>
			If more advanced functionality is needed, additional networks can be created and configured using <code class="literal">virsh</code>, and the VM’s XML configuration file can be edited to use one of these new networks.
		</p><p>
			For more information on the default configuration, see <a class="xref" href="understanding-virtual-networking-overview_configuring-and-managing-virtualization.html#virtual-networking-default-configuration_understanding-virtual-networking-overview" title="Virtual networking default configuration">the section called “Virtual networking default configuration”</a>.
		</p><p>
			If needed, guest interfaces can instead be set to one of the following modes:

			The virtual network uses network address translation (NAT) to assign IP address ranges to virtual networks and <code class="literal">dnsmasq</code> to automatically assign IP addresses to virtual machine network interface cards (NICs) and connect to a domain name service (DNS).
		</p><p>
			The following features are available for virtual networking:

				</li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="virtual-networking-routed-mode_understanding-virtual-networking-overview"/>Virtual networking in routed mode</h1></div></div></div><p>
				When using <span class="emphasis"><em>Routed</em></span> mode, the virtual switch connects to the physical LAN connected to the host machine, passing traffic back and forth without the use of NAT. The virtual switch can examine all traffic and use the information contained within the network packets to make routing decisions. When using this mode, all of the virtual machines are in their own subnet, routed through a virtual switch. This enables incoming connections, but requires extra routing-table entries for systems on the external network. Routed mode operates at Layer 3 of the OSI networking model.
			</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/vn-06-routed-switch.png" alt="vn 06 routed switch"/></div></div><h3><a id="common_topologies"/>Common topologies</h3><p>
				The following are two common topologies in which routed mode is used:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						DMZ
					</li><li class="listitem">
						Virtual server hosting
					</li></ul></div><h4><a id="dmz"/>DMZ</h4><p>
				You can create a network where one or more nodes are placed in a controlled sub-network for security reasons. Such a sub-network is known as a demilitarized zone (DMZ).
			</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/vn-09-routed-mode-DMZ.png" alt="vn 09 routed mode DMZ"/></div></div><p>
				host machines in a DMZ typically provide services to WAN (external) host machines as well as LAN (internal) host machines. Since this requires them to be accessible from multiple locations, and considering that these locations are controlled and operated in different ways based on their security and trust level, routed mode is the best configuration for this environment.
			</p><h4><a id="virtual_server_hosting"/>Virtual server hosting</h4><p>
				A virtual server hosting provider may have several host machines, each with two physical network connections. One interface is used for management and accounting, the other is for the virtual machines to connect through. Each virtual machine has its own public IP address, but the host machines use private IP addresses so that management of the virtual machines can only be performed by internal administrators.
			</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/vn-10-routed-mode-datacenter.png" alt="vn 10 routed mode datacenter"/></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="virtual-networking-bridged-mode_understanding-virtual-networking-overview"/>Virtual networking in bridged mode</h1></div></div></div><p>
				When using <span class="emphasis"><em>Bridged</em></span> mode, virtual machines (VMs) are connected to a bridge device that is also connected directly to a physical ethernet device connected to the local ethernet. As a result, the VM is directly visible on the physical network. This enables incoming connections, but does not require any extra routing-table entries.
			</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/vn-Bridged-Mode-Diagram.png" alt="vn Bridged Mode Diagram"/></div></div><p>
				A VM in bridged mode has to connect to an existing Linux bridge on the host, and therefore requires a network bridge to be created on the host interface. In contrast, other VM networking modes automatically create and connect to the <code class="literal">virbr0</code> virtual bridge.
			</p><p>
				All of the virtual machines appear within the same subnet as the host machine. All other physical machines on the same physical network are aware of the virtual machines, and can access them. Bridging operates on Layer 2 of the OSI networking model.
			</p><p>
				It is possible to use multiple physical interfaces on the hypervisor by joining them together with a bond. The bond is then added to a bridge and then virtual machines are added onto the bridge as well. However, the bonding driver has several modes of operation, and only a few of these modes work with a bridge where VMs are in use.
			</p><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
					When using bridged mode, the only bonding modes that should be used with a virtual machine are Mode 1, Mode 2, and Mode 4. Using modes 0, 3, 5, or 6 is likely to cause the connection to fail. Also note that Media-Independent Interface (MII) monitoring should be used to monitor bonding modes, as Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) monitoring does not work.
				</p></div><h3><a id="common_scenarios"/>Common scenarios</h3><p>
				The most common use cases for bridged mode include:
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
						Deploying virtual machines in an existing network alongside host machines, making the difference between virtual and physical machines transparent to the end user.
					</li><li class="listitem">

					</li><li class="listitem">
						Deploying virtual machines that must be easily accessible to an existing physical network. Placing virtual machines on a physical network where they must access services within an existing broadcast domain, such as DHCP.

				When using <span class="emphasis"><em>Isolated</em></span> mode, guests connected to the virtual switch can communicate with each other, and with the host machine, but their traffic will not pass outside of the host machine, and they cannot receive traffic from outside the host machine. Using dnsmasq in this mode is required for basic functionality such as DHCP.
			</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/vn-07-isolated-switch.png" alt="vn 07 isolated switch"/></div></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="virtual-networking-network-address-translation_understanding-virtual-networking-overview"/>Virtual networking Network Address Translation</h1></div></div></div><p>
				By default, virtual network switches operate in NAT mode. They use IP masquerading rather than Source-NAT (SNAT) or Destination-NAT (DNAT). IP masquerading enables connected guests to use the host machine IP address for communication to any external network. Computers external to the host cannot communicate to the VMs inside when the virtual network switch is operating in NAT mode.
			</p><div class="informalfigure"><div class="mediaobject"><img src="images/vn-04-hostwithnatswitch.png" alt="vn 04 hostwithnatswitch"/></div></div><div class="warning" style="margin-left: 0.5in; margin-right: 0.5in;"><h3 class="title">Warning</h3><p>
					Virtual network switches use NAT configured by iptables rules. Editing these rules while the switch is running is not recommended, because incorrect rules may result in the switch being unable to communicate.
				</p></div><p>
				If the switch is not running, you can set the public IP range for forward mode NAT in order to create a port masquerading range by running:
			</p><pre class="literallayout"># <span class="strong"><strong>iptables -j SNAT --to-source [start]-[end]</strong></span></pre></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="virtual-networking-open-mode_understanding-virtual-networking-overview"/>Virtual networking in open mode</h1></div></div></div><p>
				When using <span class="emphasis"><em>Open</em></span> mode for networking, <code class="literal">libvirt</code> does not generate any <code class="literal">iptables</code> rules for the network. As a result, <code class="literal">iptables</code> rules added outside the scope of libvirt are not overwritten, and the user can therefore manually manage <code class="literal">iptables</code> rules.
			</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="virtual-networking-dns-and-dhcp_understanding-virtual-networking-overview"/>Virtual networking DNS and DHCP</h1></div></div></div><p>
				The <code class="literal">libvirt</code> package includes <code class="literal">dnsmasq</code> to provide a Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) server and a Domain Name System (DNS) forwarder for virtual networks.
			</p><p>
				The <code class="literal">dnsmasq</code> DHCP service can assign a pool of addresses to a virtual network switch. IP information can be assigned to virtual machines via DHCP.
			</p><p>
				<code class="literal">dnsmasq</code> accepts DNS queries from virtual machines on the virtual network and forwards them to a real DNS server.
			</p><p>
				An instance of <code class="literal">dnsmasq</code> is automatically configured and started by <code class="literal">libvirt</code> for each virtual network switch that needs it.
			</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="virtual-networking-default-configuration_understanding-virtual-networking-overview"/>Virtual networking default configuration</h1></div></div></div><p>
				When the libvirtd daemon (<code class="literal">libvirtd</code>) is first installed, it contains an initial virtual network switch configuration in NAT mode. This configuration is used so that installed guests can communicate to the external network through the host machine. The following figure shows the default configuration for <code class="literal">libvirtd</code>:

					A virtual network can be restricted to a specific physical interface. This may be useful on a physical system that has several interfaces (for example, <span class="strong"><strong>eth0</strong></span>, <span class="strong"><strong>eth1</strong></span>, and <span class="strong"><strong>eth2</strong></span>). This is only useful in routed and NAT modes, and can be defined in the <code class="literal">dev=&lt;interface&gt;</code> option, or in the RHEL 8 web console when creating a new virtual network.
