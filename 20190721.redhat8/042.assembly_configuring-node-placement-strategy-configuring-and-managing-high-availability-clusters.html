			Pacemaker decides where to place a resource according to the resource allocation scores on every node. The resource will be allocated to the node where the resource has the highest score. This allocation score is derived from a combination of factors, including resource constraints, <code class="literal">resource-stickiness</code> settings, prior failure history of a resource on each node, and utilization of each node.
		</p><p>
			If the resource allocation scores on all the nodes are equal, by the default placement strategy Pacemaker will choose a node with the least number of allocated resources for balancing the load. If the number of resources on each node is equal, the first eligible node listed in the CIB will be chosen to run the resource.
		</p><p>
			Often, however, different resources use significantly different proportions of a node’s capacities (such as memory or I/O). You cannot always balance the load ideally by taking into account only the number of resources allocated to a node. In addition, if resources are placed such that their combined requirements exceed the provided capacity, they may fail to start completely or they may run run with degraded performance. To take these factors into account, Pacemaker allows you to configure the following components:
		</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
					the capacity a particular node provides
				</li><li class="listitem">
					the capacity a particular resource requires
				</li><li class="listitem">

				</li></ul></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="configuring-utilization-attributes-configuring-node-placement-strategy"/>Utilization attributes and placement strategy</h1></div></div></div><p>
				To configure the capacity that a node provides or a resource requires, you can use <span class="emphasis"><em>utilization attributes</em></span> for nodes and resources. You do this by setting a utilization variable for a resource and assigning a value to that variable to indicate what the resource requires, and then setting that same utilization variable for a node and assigning a value to that variable to indicate what that node provides.
			</p><p>
				You can name utilization attributes according to your preferences and define as many name and value pairs as your configuration needs. The values of utilization attributes must be integers.
			</p><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="configuring_node_and_resource_capacity"/>Configuring node and resource capacity</h2></div></div></div><p>
					The following example configures a utilization attribute of CPU capacity for two nodes, setting this attribute as the variable <code class="literal">cpu</code>. It also configures a utilization attribute of RAM capacity, setting this attribute as the variable <code class="literal">memory</code>. In this example:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							Node 1 is defined as providing a CPU capacity of two and a RAM capacity of 2048
						</li><li class="listitem">
							Node 2 is defined as providing a CPU capacity of four and a RAM capacity of 2048
						</li></ul></div><pre class="literallayout"># <code class="literal">pcs node utilization node1 cpu=2 memory=2048</code>
# <code class="literal">pcs node utilization node2 cpu=4 memory=2048</code></pre><p>
					The following example specifies the same utilization attributes that three different resources require. In this example:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							resource <code class="literal">dummy-small</code> requires a CPU capacity of 1 and a RAM capacity of 1024
						</li><li class="listitem">
							resource <code class="literal">dummy-medium</code> requires a CPU capacity of 2 and a RAM capacity of 2048
						</li><li class="listitem">
							resource <code class="literal">dummy-large</code> requires a CPU capacity of 1 and a RAM capacity of 3072
						</li></ul></div><pre class="literallayout"># <code class="literal">pcs resource utilization dummy-small cpu=1 memory=1024</code>
# <code class="literal">pcs resource utilization dummy-medium cpu=2 memory=2048</code>
# <code class="literal">pcs resource utilization dummy-large cpu=3 memory=3072</code></pre><p>
					A node is considered eligible for a resource if it has sufficient free capacity to satisfy the resource’s requirements, as defined by the utilization attributes.
				</p></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h2 class="title"><a id="configuring_placement_strategy"/>Configuring placement strategy</h2></div></div></div><p>
					After you have configured the capacities your nodes provide and the capacities your resources require, you need to set the <code class="literal">placement-strategy</code> cluster property, otherwise the capacity configurations have no effect.
				</p><p>
					Four values are available for the <code class="literal">placement-strategy</code> cluster property:
				</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem">
							<code class="literal">default</code> — Utilization values are not taken into account at all. Resources are allocated according to allocation scores. If scores are equal, resources are evenly distributed across nodes.
						</li><li class="listitem">
							<code class="literal">utilization</code> — Utilization values are taken into account only when deciding whether a node is considered eligible (that is, whether it has sufficient free capacity to satisfy the resource’s requirements). Load-balancing is still done based on the number of resources allocated to a node.
						</li><li class="listitem">
							<code class="literal">balanced</code> — Utilization values are taken into account when deciding whether a node is eligible to serve a resource and when load-balancing, so an attempt is made to spread the resources in a way that optimizes resource performance.
						</li><li class="listitem">
							<code class="literal">minimal</code> — Utilization values are taken into account only when deciding whether a node is eligible to serve a resource. For load-balancing, an attempt is made to concentrate the resources on as few nodes as possible, thereby enabling possible power savings on the remaining nodes.
						</li></ul></div><p>
					The following example command sets the value of <code class="literal">placement-strategy</code> to <code class="literal">balanced</code>. After running this command, Pacemaker will ensure the load from your resources will be distributed evenly throughout the cluster, without the need for complicated sets of colocation constraints.

				To ensure that Pacemaker’s placement strategy for resources works most effectively, you should take the following considerations into account when configuring your system.
			</p><div class="itemizedlist"><ul class="itemizedlist"><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						Make sure that you have sufficient physical capacity.
					</p><p class="simpara">
						If the physical capacity of your nodes is being used to near maximum under normal conditions, then problems could occur during failover. Even without the utilization feature, you may start to experience timeouts and secondary failures.
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						Build some buffer into the capabilities you configure for the nodes.
					</p><p class="simpara">
						Advertise slightly more node resources than you physically have, on the assumption the that a Pacemaker resource will not use 100% of the configured amount of CPU, memory, and so forth all the time. This practice is sometimes called overcommit.
					</p></li><li class="listitem"><p class="simpara">
						Specify resource priorities.
					</p><p class="simpara">
						If the cluster is going to sacrifice services, it should be the ones you care about least. Ensure that resource priorities are properly set so that your most important resources are scheduled first.
					</p></li></ul></div></div><div class="section"><div class="titlepage"><div><div><h1 class="title"><a id="node-utilization-resource-agent-configuring-node-placement-strategy"/>The NodeUtilization resource agent</h1></div></div></div><p>
				The NodeUtilization agent can detect the system parameters of available CPU, host memory availability, and hypervisor memory availability and add these parameters into the CIB. You can run the agent as a clone resource to have it automatically populate these parameters on each node.
