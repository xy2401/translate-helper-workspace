			Red Hat classifies container use cases into two distinct groups: single node and multi-node, with multi-node sometimes called distributed systems. OpenShift was built for multi-node systems, although single-node, all-in-one installations are supported as well. Beyond OpenShift, however, it is useful to have a small, nimble set of tools for working with containers.
		</p><p>
			The set of container tools we are referring to can be used in a single-node use case. However, you can also wire these tools into existing build systems, CI/CD environments, and even use them to tackle workload-specific use cases, such as big data. To target the single-node use case, Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) 8 offers a set of tools to find, run, build, and share individual containers.
		</p><p>
			This guide describes how to work with Linux containers on RHEL 8 systems using command-line tools such as podman, buildah, skopeo and runc. In addition to these tools, Red Hat provides base images, to act as the foundation for your own images. Some of these base images target use cases ranging from business applications (such as Node.js, PHP, Java, and Python) to infrastructure (such as logging, data collection, and authentication).
