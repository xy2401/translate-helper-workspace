			Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 introduces the concept of Application Streams. Multiple versions of user space components are now delivered and updated more frequently than the core operating system packages. This provides greater flexibility to customize Red Hat Enterprise Linux without impacting the underlying stability of the platform or specific deployments.
		</p><p>
			Components made available as Application Streams can be packaged as modules or RPM packages and are delivered through the AppStream repository in RHEL 8. Each Application Stream component has a given life cycle, see <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/node/4079021">Red Hat Enterprise Linux 8 Application Streams Life Cycle</a>.
		</p><p>
			Modules are collections of packages representing a logical unit: an application, a language stack, a database, or a set of tools. These packages are built, tested, and released together.
		</p><p>
			Module streams represent versions of the Application Stream components. For example, two streams (versions) of the PostgreSQL database server are available in the postgresql module: PostgreSQL 10 (the default stream) and PostgreSQL 9.6. Only one module stream can be installed on the system. Different versions can be used in separate containers.

			Detailed module commands are described in the <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/installing_managing_and_removing_user_space_components/">Installing, managing, and removing user space components</a> document. For a list of modules available in AppStream, see the <a class="link" href="https://access.redhat.com/documentation/en-us/red_hat_enterprise_linux/8/html-single/package_manifest/#chap-AppStream_Modules">Package manifest</a>.
