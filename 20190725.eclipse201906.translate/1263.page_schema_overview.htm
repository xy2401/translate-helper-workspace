		<h2>Schema Overview Page</h2>

		<h3>About This Page</h3>
		
		<p>
			This form page allows you to identify and document an extension point schema.
			It also allows you to include and use grammars defined by other shared extension point schemas.
		</p>
		
		<h3>Page Sections</h3>
		
		<p>
			This page is comprised of the following sections:
		</p>		
		
		<ul>
			<li>
				<a href="#information">General Information Section</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#inclusions">Schema Inclusions Section</a>
			</li>
			<li>
				<a href="#documentation">Documentation Section</a>
			</li>	
		</ul>

		<a name="information"></a>
		<h3>General Information Section</h3>

		<p>
			This section uniquely identifies the edited extension point schema. 
			The format of an extension point schema ID is the same as the
			fully qualified ID of its corresponding extension point:  
			<em>&lt;plugin-id&gt;.&lt;point-id&gt;</em>
		</p>

		<p>

		</p>

		<h3>General Information Section Fields</h3>

		<p>
			Edit the <strong>Plug-in ID</strong> field to specify the qualifier portion
			of the unique extension point schema ID.  This field's value should match the
			the ID of the plug-in that the schema's corresponding extension point is defined in.
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit the <strong>Point ID</strong> field to specify the ID portion of the
			unique extension point schema ID.  This field's value should match the
			ID used to define the schema's corresponding extension point.
		</p>
		
		<p>
			Edit the <strong>Point Name</strong> field to specify a human-readable
			name for the extension point schema.  This field's value should match
			the name used to define the schema's corresponding extension point.
		</p>		

		<a name="inclusions"></a>
		<h3>Schema Inclusions Section</h3>

		<p>
			This section allows you to include and use the grammar from other shared 
			extension point schemas.
		</p>
		
		<p>

		</p>

		<h3>Schema Inclusions Section Fields</h3>
		
		<p>
			The viewer field lists the shared extension point schemas whose 
			grammars are included and used by the edited extension point schema.
		</p>

		<p>
			Shared extension point schemas located in the same plug-in as the
			edited extension point schema may be included.
			These schemas are represented in the viewer by a relative path to 
			their file name:  
			<em>&lt;relative-path&gt;/&lt;schema-file-name&gt;</em>
		</p>

		<p>
			Shared extension point schemas located in the another workspace
			plug-in may be included.
			These schemas are represented in the viewer by a special
			absolute path to their file name:  
			<em>schema://&lt;defining-plugin-id&gt;/&lt;path&gt;/&lt;schema-file-name&gt;</em>
		</p>

		<h3>Schema Inclusions Section Actions</h3>
		
		<p>
			Click the <strong>Add...</strong> button, to open the <strong>File Selection</strong>
			dialog in order to include and use the grammar from an existing shared extension point 
			schema in the edited schema.
			The dialog presents a filtered hierarchical view of all workspace extension point 
			schemas.  If an extension point schema contained in a different plug-in than the
			edited schema is selected, a special absolute path will be constructed and entered
			into the viewer field.  If an extension point schema contained in the same plug-in
			as the edited schema is selected, a relative path from the edited schema to the
			selected schema is computed and entered into the viewer field.
		</p>

		<p>
			Click the <strong>Remove</strong> button, to remove the selected shared extension
			point schema's grammar from inclusion and use by the edited extension point schema.
			This action is available only when a schema is selected in the viewer field.
		</p>

		<p>
			Double-click an extension point schema in the viewer field to open that schema
			in a new <strong>Extension Point Schema Editor</strong>.
		</p>

		<a name="documentation"></a>
		<h3>Documentation Section</h3>

		<p>
			This section allows you to document the edited extension point schema.
			It's contents will be used to compose the edited extension point
			schema's reference document.  As a result, valid HTML mark-up may be used 
			in any of the section's fields.
		</p>

		<p>
			This section contains the following tabs:
		</p>

		<ul>
			<li>
				Description
			</li>
			<li>
				Since
			</li>
			<li>
				Examples
			</li>
			<li>
				API Information

		<h3>Documentation Section Fields</h3>
		
		<p>
			Edit the <strong>Description</strong> tab's field to specify a detailed 
			description of the defining extension point for this edited schema.  
			Typically, this field is used to describe the extension point's
			purpose, utility and associated concepts.
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit the <strong>Since</strong> tab's field to specify the version of
			Eclipse this edited schema was first added to.  For example,
			if this edited schema was first added to Eclipse 3.0, 
			the field's value should be <em>3.0</em>.
			The assumption is that the edited schema's grammar is API that
			persists release to release once introduced and is maintained for backwards
			compatibility.  This field is analogous to Java's <em>Javadoc</em> 
			<em>@since</em> tag.
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit the <strong>Examples</strong> tab's field to specify 
			a valid XML snippet of the extension that conforms to this edited 
			schema's grammar.  Try to use an example that illustrates a typical 
			use case of the extension.
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit the <strong>API Information</strong> tab's field to describe
			the structure, content and semantics of the extension point's elements and attributes. 
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit the <strong>Supplied Implementation</strong> tab's field to 
			specify whether the plug-in that defines the extension point for 
			this edited schema also contributes extensions for it.  This field
			points the user to an actual extension implementation that they can
			use as a template or reference for defining their own extensions.
		</p>

		<p>
			Edit the <strong>Copyright</strong> tab's field to outline the exclusive legal 
			rights to reproduce, publish, sell, or distribute the edited schema.
		</p>
