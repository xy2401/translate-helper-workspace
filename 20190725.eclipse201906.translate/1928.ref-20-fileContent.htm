  preference page, you can associate 
  file names or extensions with the type of data the file contains. The two choices 
  for file content type are ASCII and Binary. Repository providers such as CVS 
  can then use this information to provide content type appropriate behavior. 
  For example, for ASCII files, CVS ensures that line terminators conform to those 
  of the OS platform.</p> 
<P CLASS="Intro">Entries are added to the File Content page in two ways. The first 
  is through contributions from workbench plug-ins. Tools integrated into the 
  workbench provide the workbench with the file content types for file extensions 
  specific to the tool. The workbench itself also defines the file content type 
  for file extensions that are common and appear frequently in the workbench (e.g. 
  html,.png, etc.).</p> 
<P CLASS="Intro">The second method is for users to add file content types explicitly 
  on the File Content preference page. To do so, you can simply click on 
  the <strong>Add Extension</strong> button and enter an extension or click on 
  the <strong>Add Name</strong> button and add a name.. Following this, you can 
  toggle the type associated with the name or extension by selecting the entry 
  for the extension in the table and clicking <strong>Change</strong>. Entries 
  can be removed from the list by selecting them and clicking <strong>Remove</strong>. 
  Only those entries that were manually added can be removed. Entries contributed 
  through the plug-in manifest can only be changed.</p>
