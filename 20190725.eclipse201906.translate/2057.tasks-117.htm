<H1>Sharing a new project using CVS</H1>

<P>There are several scenarios that can occur when sharing a project using CVS. 
The most common scenario is sharing a new project using CVS when the project 
does not already exist remotely.
</P>
  
<P>To share a new project using CVS:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>In one of the navigation views, select the project to be shared.</li>
  <li>Select <b>Team &gt;</b> <b>Share Project...</b> from the project's pop-up 
    menu. The Share Project wizard opens.</li>
  <li>From the list of available repository providers, choose <b>CVS</b> and click 
    <b>Next </b>to go to the next page. (<b>Note</b>: If CVS is not present in 
    the list, it may be disabled. Clicking on the <strong>Show All Wizards</strong> 
    button should make it visible. Also note that if there is only repository provider registered
    for your workspace, you will automatically bypass this step entirely.)</li>
  <li>Select the target repository from the list of known repositories or, if 
    the target repository is not in this list, choose to create a new repository 
    location and click <b>Next</b>.</li>
  <li>If entering a new repository location, enter the repository information 
    and click <b>Next</b> when completed. (<b>Note</b>: this page is the same 
    format as the <a href="tasks-92.htm">Creating a CVS repository location</a> 
    wizard.)</li>
  <li>Either choose to use the name of the local project as the remote project 
    name or enter another name and click <strong>Next</strong>.</li>
  <li>The final page shows you the resources of the new project as outgoing additions. 
    You can choose to commit or ignore resources from this page. (<b>Note</b>: 
    If the project already exists remotely, the page will show conflicts on any 
    files that exist both locally and remotely. Only those files whose contents 
    do not match are shown.)</li>
  <li>Click <b>Finish</b> to share the project with the repository. You will be 
    prompted to commit any resources in the new project that have not yet been 
    committed or ignored. Choosing to do so will run the commit operation in the 
    background. </li>
</ol>

<h4>Consequences for Linked Resources</h4>
<p>As mentioned in <a href="../concepts/concepts-13.htm">Linked resources</a>, different
providers may handle linked resources differently.  For Team CVS, linked resources
are allowed but ignored.  Specifically, projects which contain linked resources can be shared with CVS,
but the linked resources themselves cannot be version controlled.</p>
