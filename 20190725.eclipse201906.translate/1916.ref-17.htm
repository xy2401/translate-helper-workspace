          This option allows the platform to computes the build ordering.

          <P>Often the order in which projects are built is important.&nbsp; For
example, if one project requires the Java classes which were defined in another
project, the first project must be built after its prerequisite classes have
been built.&nbsp; The Workbench allows users to explicitly define the order in
which projects are built. Alternatively, users can let the platform compute the
build order by interpreting project references as prerequisite relationships.
The build order is applied for both building the entire workspace or for a group
of projects.&nbsp;<P></TD>

      <TD ROWSPAN="1" COLSPAN="1" valign="top" align="left"> <P CLASS="Para">This 
          preference allows you to deal with build orders that contain cycles. 
          Ideally, you should avoid cyclic references between projects. Projects 
          with cycles really logically belong to a single project, and so they 
          should be collapsed into a single project if possible. However, if you 
          absolutely must have cycles, it may take several iterations of the build 
          order to correctly build everything. Changing this preference will alter 
          the maximum number of times the workbench will attempt to iterate over 
          the build order before giving up.</P></TD>

      <TD>Max simultaneous project builds</TD>
      <TD>Under some safe circumstances, the workspace can chose to build independent projects in parallel. In such
      case, this preference controls the maximum amount of jobs/threads that will be running builds in parallel. A value of
      <code>1</code> indicates that build won't be parallelized and keeps the legacy behavior.</p>
      <p>The optimal value depends on your machine and workspace projects specificities. We do recommend to try relatively
      low values (such as <code>4</code>) first which already allow to save time, when projects allow it, while not risking to
      overload your CPU.</TD>
