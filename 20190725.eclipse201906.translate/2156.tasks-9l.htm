<H1>Detaching views and editors</H1>

<p>Detached views and editors are shown in a separate window with a smaller trim.
  They work like other views and editors except they they are always shown in front of the Workbench window.
</p>

<p>To detach a view:</p>
<ol>
  <li>If the Workbench window is maximized, resize it so that it does not fill the entire screen.</li>
  <li>Click the title bar of the view that you want to detach. Hold the mouse button down.</li>
  <li>Drag the view outside of the Workbench window and release the mouse button. You can also
  drag the view into the window of a previously detached view to have multiple detached views together.</li>
</ol>

<p>To restore the view to be shown inside of the Workbench window, drag the view tab into the
  Workbench window.
</p>

<p>The same procedure can be followed to detach and restore editors. </p>
