<H1 CLASS="Head">Setting the CVS keyword substitution mode</H1>

<P>CVS uses the keyword substitution mode of a file to differentiate binary files 
from ASCII files and to indicate what type of keyword substitution is to take 
place when files are committed and checked out.
</P>
  
<P>To set the CVS keyword substitution mode:
</P>

<ol>
  <li>In one of the navigation views, select the files or containing folders for which 
    a change in keyword substitution mode is desired. <b>Note</b>: Ensure that 
    any new files that are to be committed are added to CVS version control as 
    the keyword substitution mode can only be set for files that are already under 
    CVS control.</li>
  <li>From the pop-up menu, select<b> Team &gt; Change ASCII/Binary Property</b>. 
    The Set Keyword Substitution Mode wizard will open. The following dialog was opened 
    was opened on the org.eclipse.jdt.core project:
    <p><img src="../images/cvs_change_ascii_binary_prop.png" alt="The Set Keyword Substitution Mode wizard" border="0" ></p>
  </li>
  <li>The wizard contains a list of all founds found in the selection. On this 
    page, you can do the following: 
    <ul>
      <li>You can enter a file pattern to filter the list of files.</li>
      <li>You can change the mode for files individually.</li>
      <li>You can select multiple files and change the mode for the all using 
        the drop down at the bottom of the page.</li>
      <li>You can select multiple files and click <strong>Propose</strong> which 
        determines the mode based on your preference settings.</li>
      <li>You can check the <em>Only show those files that will be changed</em> option to see only the files 
        whose mode has been changed in the wizard.</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>When you are done specifying the new modes for any files, enter the commit 
    comment to be associated with any file commits. Files will need to be committed 
    if changing the file type from Binary to ASCII results in a change in the 
    file content due to line terminator adjustments. Click <b>Finish</b> to apply 
    the changes.</li>
</ol>
