<H1>Synchronizing with the repository</H1>
Working with shared resources requires tracking their state in context of the repository
content. This could be done by creating a synchronization that populates the Synchronize
view and benefiting following advantages:
<ul>
  <li>The local modification state of the resources being synchronized is kept 
    up-to-date. This means that, if you modify a file locally that is within the 
    scope of a synchronization that appears in the Synchronize view, the resource 
    will appear automatically in the view, if it is not already there.</li>
  <li>The remote state of all of the resources being synchronized can be refreshed 
    using the Synchronize <img src="../images/synch_participants.png" alt="" border="0" > 
    button in the toolbar of the Synchronize view.</li>
  <li>The remote state of a selection of resources can be refreshed using the 
    Synchronize command from the context menu in the Synchronize view.</li>
</ul>
<p>Following methods can be used to create a synchronization.</p> 
<h2>Method 1: Using the context menu</h2>
<p>To synchronize resources in the Workbench with those in the repository: </p>

<ol>
  <li>In one of the navigation views, select the resources that you want to synchronize.</li>
  <li>Right click and select <b>Team &gt; Synchronize with Repository</b>. The 
    Synchronize view opens.</li>
</ol>
<h2>Method 2: Using the synchronize action</h2>
<ol>
  <li>From the Team Synchronizing perspective select the <strong>Synchronize...</strong> 
    action from the Synchronize <img src="../images/synch_participants.png" alt="" border="0" > 
    button drop down.</li>
  <li>Select <strong>CVS</strong> from the list of possible synchronization types 
    and click <strong>Next</strong>.<br><em>Note:</em> If there are no other repository providers registered with the
    Workbench, then you will bypass this screen altogether.</li>
  <li>Select the resource scope for the synchronize by either selecting Workspace, 
    Selected Resources or Working Set. Then select <strong>Finish.</strong></li>
  <li>The Synchronize view will open.</li>
</ol>
<p> <em>Note</em>: The synchronize action is not enabled by default in 
  other perspectives. You can enable the action to appear in your current perspective 
  by selecting
  <a class="command-link" href='javascript:executeCommand("org.eclipse.ui.window.customizePerspective")'>
  <img src="PLUGINS_ROOT/org.eclipse.help/command_link.svg" alt="command link">
  <strong>Window &gt; Perspective &gt; Customize Perspective</strong></a>. Then click 
  on the <strong>Commands</strong> tab and check off <strong>Team</strong>.</p>
<p><em>Tip</em>: You can use method 3 below to avoid loosing the created synchronization.</p>
<h2>Method 3: Using a pinned CVS Workspace Synchronization in the Synchronize 
  view</h2>
<p>Once you have a CVS workspace synchronization in the Synchronize view, you 
  can pin it. This will prevent it from being replaced by the next CVS workspace 
  synchronization that is launched using one of the previous 2 methods. Here are 
  some of the advantages of using a pinned synchronization.</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can remove any not pinned synchronization to make the pinned one visible.
    To do it select <strong>Remove Current Synchronization</strong> from the Synchronize
    view toolbar's menu.</li>
  <li>You can schedule the refreshing of the remote state to happen at particular 
    intervals (each hour, for example)</li>
</ul>
<p>The implications of this is that you can see you outgoing resources without 
  re-fetching the remote state from the server (a potentially long running operation). 
  Also, the fetching of the remote state is run in the background so you can do 
  other things (e.g. inspect changes) while the remote state is fetched.</p>
<h3>From within the synchronize view</h3>
<p>Use the toolbar buttons to switch modes for this view. There are four modes:</p> 
<ul>
  <li>Incoming mode - shows incoming changes only (resources in the repository 
    that differ from what is in the Workbench).</li>
  <li>Outgoing mode - shows outgoing changes only (resources modified in the 
    Workbench).</li>
  <li>Incoming/Outgoing mode - shows both incoming and outgoing changes.</li>
  <li>Conflicts mode - shows only conflicting resources.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Note:</em> It is possible that someone has committed a new revision of your
  file since you started working on it. This will result in a <em>conflict</em>, and care 
  must be taken to resolve this. For this reason, conflicts are shown in all modes of the
  Synchronize view.
</p>
<p><em>Important:</em> It is preferable to update resources in the Workbench 
  first, resolve any conflicts that exist by merging, then commit Workbench 
  resources to the repository.
</p>
