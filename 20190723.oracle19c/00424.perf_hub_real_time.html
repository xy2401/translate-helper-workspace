            <p>This is a screenshot of the Performance Hub page when Real Time - Last Hour is selected in the Select Time Period field.</p>
            <p>The Performance Hub title is at the top left of the page, which indicates that Real Time - Last Hour is selected from the Select Time Period field. To the right of the Select Time Period field is the Hide Time Picker icon. To the right of the Hide Time Picker icon is the PerfHub Report icon. To the right of the PerfHub Report icon is the AWR Report icon. To the far right is the Page Refreshed field and the time that the page was last refreshed.</p>
            <p>The time picker appears below the user interface elements at the top of the page. It consists of performance data for the selected period of time.</p>
            <p>Below the time picker are five tabs, which are the Summary, Activity, Workload, Monitored SQL, and ADDM tabs. The Summary tab is displayed.</p>
            <p>At the top left of the Summary tab is the Host: Runnable Processes chart. It displays CPU Cores, Load Average, Other Host CPU, Background CPU Usage Per Sec, and Foreground CPU Usage Per Sec data.</p>
            <p>To the right of the Host: Runnable Processes chart is the Memory: Host Total chart. It displays Total PGA, Streams Pool, Java Pool, Shared Pool, and Buffer Cache data.</p>
            <p>Below the Host: Runnable Processes chart, the Active Sessions section appears. It includes two tabs: the Activity tab (which is displayed) and the Services tab. </p>
            <p>The Activity tab can display Foreground Only or Foreground + Background data. The Foreground Only option is selected, and data for CPU Cores, Average Active Sessions, Miscellaneous (Concurrency, CPU, System I/O, Commit, User I/O, Other, and Network), and Application is displayed.</p>
            <p>The Services tab displays data for SYS$USERS.</p>
