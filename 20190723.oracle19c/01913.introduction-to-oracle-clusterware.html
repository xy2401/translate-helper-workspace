               <p>Oracle Clusterware concepts and components.</p>
               <p>Oracle Clusterware enables servers to communicate with each other, so that they appear to function as a collective unit. This combination of servers is commonly known as a cluster. Although the servers are standalone servers, each server has additional processes that communicate with other servers. In this way the separate servers appear as if they are one system to applications and end users.</p>

                  <p>Oracle Clusterware is portable cluster software that provides comprehensive multi-tiered high availability and resource management for consolidated environments. It supports clustering of independent servers so that they cooperate as a single system.</p>
                  <p>Oracle Clusterware is the integrated foundation for Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC), and the high-availability and resource management framework for all applications on any major platform. Oracle Clusterware was first released with Oracle Database 10<span class="italic">g</span> release 1 (10.1) as the required cluster technology for the Oracle multi-instance database, Oracle RAC. The intent is to leverage Oracle Clusterware in the cloud to provide enterprise-class resiliency where required, and dynamic, online allocation of compute resources where and when they are needed.
                  </p>
                  <div class="section">
                     <p class="subhead2" id="GUID-70F77528-480D-4A4A-99F9-330A447CACE3__GUID-2B2C2DB9-96A9-48BE-8ED9-28CD41BF137E">Oracle Flex Clusters</p>
                     <p>In Oracle Clusterware 12<span class="italic">c</span> release 2 (12.2), all clusters are configured as Oracle Flex Clusters, meaning that a cluster is configured with one or more <a href="glossary.html#GUID-8AD68754-1C50-408B-82A9-61D132FC09F9"><span class="xrefglossterm">Hub Node</span></a>s, which can support a large number of nodes. Clusters currently configured under older versions of Oracle Clusterware are converted in place as part of the upgrade process, including the activation of Oracle Flex ASM (which is a requirement for Oracle Flex Clusters).

                     <p>Hub Nodes are tightly connected, and have direct access to shared storage. They would traditionally be deployed as hosts for Oracle RAC or Oracle RAC One database instances. Other nodes in the cluster differ from Hub Nodes in that they do not require direct access to shared storage, but instead access data through the Hub Nodes.</p>
                     <p>All nodes in an Oracle Flex Cluster belong to a single Oracle Grid Infrastructure cluster. This architecture centralizes policy decisions for deployment of resources based on application needs, to account for various service levels, loads, failure responses, and recovery.</p>
                     <p>Oracle Flex Clusters consists of Hub Nodes that support other nodes in the cluster. The number of Hub Nodes in an Oracle Flex Cluster must be at least one and can be as many as 64, while the number of other, supported nodes can be many more. Hub Nodes can host different types of applications.</p>
                     <p>Oracle Flex Clusters may operate with one or many Hub Nodes, but other nodes are optional and can only exist as members of a cluster that includes at least one Hub Node.</p>
                     <p>The benefits of using a cluster include:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>

                     </ul>
                     <p>You can configure Oracle Clusterware to manage the availability of user applications and Oracle databases. In an Oracle RAC environment, Oracle Clusterware manages all of the resources automatically. All of the applications and processes that Oracle Clusterware manages are either <a href="glossary.html#GUID-63DE6C85-1C46-4574-BF63-F63EEFC76374"><span class="xrefglossterm">cluster resource</span></a>s or <a href="glossary.html#GUID-0A94FDFD-832F-409A-A6E4-C8FF1C68FB24"><span class="xrefglossterm">local resource</span></a>s.
                     </p>
                     <p>Oracle Clusterware is required for using Oracle RAC; it is the only clusterware that you need for platforms on which Oracle RAC operates. Although Oracle RAC continues to support many third-party clusterware products on specific platforms, you must also install and use Oracle Clusterware. Note that the servers on which you want to install and run Oracle Clusterware must use the same operating system.</p>
                     <p>Using Oracle Clusterware eliminates the need for proprietary vendor clusterware and provides the benefit of using only Oracle software. Oracle provides an entire software solution, including everything from disk management with Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM) to data management with Oracle Database and Oracle RAC. In addition, Oracle Database features, such as Oracle Services, provide advanced functionality when used with the underlying Oracle Clusterware high-availability framework. </p>
                     <p>Oracle Clusterware has two stored components, besides the binaries: The voting files, which record node membership information, and the Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR), which records cluster configuration information. Voting files and OCRs must reside on shared storage available to all cluster member nodes.</p>

                     <p>A domain services cluster is an Oracle Flex Cluster that has one or more Hub Nodes (for database instances) and zero or more other nodes. Shared storage is locally mounted on each of the Hub Nodes and an Oracle ASM instance is available to all Hub Nodes. In addition, a management database is stored and accessed, locally, within the cluster. This deployment is also used for an upgraded, pre-existing cluster.</p>
                     <p>A member cluster groups multiple cluster configurations for management purposes and makes use of shared services available within that cluster domain. The cluster configurations within that cluster domain are:</p>

                     <p>A node that is part of a cluster requires a second network. This second network is referred to as the interconnect. For this reason, cluster member nodes require at least two network interface cards: one for a public network and one for a private network. The interconnect network is a private network using a switch (or multiple switches) that only the nodes in the cluster can access.<a id="fn_1" name="fn_1" href="#fn_1" onclick="footdisplay(1, "Oracle Clusterware supports up to 100 nodes in a cluster on configurations running Oracle Database 10g release 2 (10.2) and later releases.")"><sup>Foot&nbsp;1</sup></a>

                     <p>Cluster size is determined by the requirements of the workload running on the cluster and the number of nodes that you have configured in the cluster. If you are implementing a cluster for high availability, then configure redundancy for all of the components of the infrastructure as follows:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>At least two network interfaces for the public network, bonded to provide one address</p>
                        </li>

                     </ul>
                     <p>The cluster requires shared connection to storage for each server in the cluster. Oracle Clusterware supports Network File Systems (NFSs), iSCSI, Direct Attached Storage (DAS), Storage Area Network (SAN) storage, and Network Attached Storage (NAS).</p>
                     <p>To provide redundancy for storage, generally provide at least two connections from each server to the cluster-aware storage. There may be more connections depending on your I/O requirements. It is important to consider the I/O requirements of the entire cluster when choosing your storage subsystem.</p>
                     <p>Most servers have at least one local disk that is internal to the server. Often, this disk is used for the operating system binaries; you can also use this disk for the Oracle software binaries. The benefit of each server having its own copy of the Oracle binaries is that it increases high availability, so that corruption of one binary does not affect all of the nodes in the cluster simultaneously. It also allows rolling upgrades, which reduce downtime.</p>

                     <p>Oracle Clusterware uses voting files to provide fencing and cluster node membership determination. Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) provides cluster configuration information. Collectively, voting files and OCR are referred to as Oracle Clusteware files.</p>
                     <p>Oracle Clusterware files must be stored on Oracle ASM. If the underlying storage for the Oracle ASM disks is not <span class="italic">hardware protected</span>, such as RAID, then Oracle recommends that you configure multiple locations for OCR and voting files. The voting files and OCR are described as follows:

                           <p>Oracle Clusterware uses voting files to determine which nodes are members of a cluster. You can configure voting files on Oracle ASM, or you can configure voting files on shared storage.</p>
                           <p>If you configure voting files on Oracle ASM, then you do not need to manually configure the voting files. Depending on the redundancy of your disk group, an appropriate number of voting files are created.</p>
                           <p>If you do not configure voting files on Oracle ASM, then for high availability, Oracle recommends that you have a minimum of three voting files on physically separate storage. This avoids having a single point of failure. If you configure a single voting file, then you must use external mirroring to provide redundancy.</p>
                           <p>Oracle recommends that you do not use more than five voting files, even though Oracle supports a maximum number of 15 voting files.</p>

                     <p>The cluster in which the GNS server runs is referred to as the <a href="glossary.html#GUID-3328745C-7AEE-41A0-B6E5-E7C9CA2D358F"><span class="xrefglossterm">server cluster</span></a>.

Only one GNS daemon process can run on the server cluster. Oracle Clusterware puts the GNS daemon process on one of the nodes in the cluster to maintain availability.
                     </p>
                     <p>In previous, single-cluster versions of GNS, the single cluster could easily locate the GNS service provider within itself.

                        <p>Oracle Clusterware can use the Single Client Access Name (SCAN) for dynamic VIP address configuration, removing the need to perform manual server configuration. </p>
                        <p>The SCAN is a domain name registered to at least one and up to three IP addresses, either in DNS or GNS. When using GNS and DHCP, Oracle Clusterware configures the VIP addresses for the SCAN name that is provided during cluster configuration.</p>
                        <p>The node VIP and the three SCAN VIPs are obtained from the DHCP server when using GNS. If a new server joins the cluster, then Oracle Clusterware dynamically obtains the required VIP address from the DHCP server, updates the cluster resource, and makes the server accessible through GNS.</p>

When you have Oracle RAC installed, the CRSD process monitors the Oracle database instance, listener, and so on, and automatically restarts these components when a failure occurs.</p>

                           <p>Oracle Clusterware 19c provides CRSCTL commands to disable a given cipher suite, and stores disabled cipher suite details in Oracle Local Registry and Oracle Cluster Registry, ensuring that cipher suites included on the disabled list are not used to negotiate transport layer security.</p>
                           <p>The Oracle Clusterware technology stack uses the GIPC library for both inter-node and intra-node communication. To secure an inter-node communication channel, the GIPC library uses transport layer security. For any Oracle Clusterware release, the GIPC library supports a set of precompiled cipher suites. Over time, a cipher suite may get compromised. Prior to Oracle Clusterware 19c, there was no way to disable a given cipher suite included in the set, in order to prevent it from being used in any new connections in the future.</p>

                  <p>In-place patching replaces the Oracle Clusterware software with the newer version in the same Grid home. Out-of-place upgrade has both versions of the same software present on the nodes at the same time, in different Grid homes, but only one version is active. </p>
                  <p>For Oracle Clusterware 12<span class="italic">c</span>, Oracle supports in-place or out-of-place patching. Oracle supports only out-of-place upgrades, because Oracle Clusterware 12<span class="italic">c</span> must have its own, new Grid home. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Oracle supports patch bundles and one-off patches for in-place patching but only supports patch sets and major point releases as out-of-place upgrades.</p>
                  <p>Rolling upgrades avoid downtime and ensure continuous availability of Oracle Clusterware while the software is upgraded to the new version. When you upgrade to Oracle Clusterware 12<span class="italic">c</span>, Oracle Clusterware and Oracle ASM binaries are installed as a single binary called the Oracle Grid Infrastructure. You can upgrade Oracle Clusterware and Oracle ASM in a rolling manner from Oracle Clusterware 11<span class="italic">g</span> release 2 (11.2).
                  </p>
                  <p>Oracle supports force upgrades in cases where some nodes of the cluster are down.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>The Grid Infrastructure Management Repository stores information about the cluster, such as real-time performance data and metadata that various cluster clients collect and require.</p>
                  <p>In previous versions of Oracle Grid Infrastructure, the Grid Infrastructure Management Repository was a standalone database in the Grid Infrastructure home. This required disk space in the first disk group created, sharing that space with the Oracle Cluster Registry (OCR) and the voting disk. For standalone clusters, you can install the Grid Infrastructure Management Repository into its own MGMT disk group, along with the OCR backup files during Oracle Grid Infrastructure installation.</p>
                  <p>Oracle Member Clusters use the Grid Infrastructure Management Repository service located in its Domain Services Cluster, where its Grid Infrastructure Management Repository is a pluggable database (PDB) within the Grid Infrastructure Management Repository container database (CDB) of the Domain Services Cluster. This removes the requirement to run a local Grid Infrastructure Management Repository and locate its data files in the member cluster's disk group.</p>
                  <p>Additionally, you can install both the local Grid Infrastructure Management Repository and Domain Services Cluster Grid Infrastructure Management Repository into the MGMT disk group during installation of Oracle Grid Infrastructure. It is mandatory for the domain services cluster to be located in a disk group separate from the OCR and voting disk.</p>
                  <p>The Grid Infrastructure Management Repository:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

The tool continuously tracks the operating system resource consumption at the node, process, and device levels. It collects and analyzes the clusterwide data. In real-time mode, when thresholds are met, the tool shows an alert to the user. For root-cause analysis, historical data can be replayed to understand what was happening at the time of failure.

                  <p>Cloning nodes is one method of creating new clusters.  Use cloning to quickly create several clusters of the same configuration.</p>
                  <p>The cloning process copies Oracle Clusterware software images to other nodes that have similar hardware and software. Before using cloning, you must install an Oracle Clusterware home successfully on at least one node using the instructions in your platform-specific Oracle Clusterware installation guide.</p>
                  <p>For new installations, or if you must install on only one cluster, Oracle recommends that you use the automated and interactive installation methods, such as Oracle Universal Installer or the Provisioning Pack feature of Oracle Enterprise Manager. These methods perform installation checks to ensure a successful installation. To add or delete Oracle Clusterware to or from nodes in the cluster, use the <code class="codeph">gridsetup.sh</code> script.

               <div>
                  <p>Oracle Clusterware provides many high availability application programming interfaces called CLSCRS APIs that you use to enable Oracle Clusterware to manage applications or processes that run in a cluster. The CLSCRS APIs enable you to provide high availability for all of your applications.</p>
                  <p>You can define a VIP address for an application to enable users to access the application independently of the node in the cluster on which the application is running. This is referred to as the application VIP. You can define multiple application VIPs, with generally one application VIP defined for each application running. The application VIP is related to the application by making it dependent on the application resource defined by Oracle Clusterware.</p>
                  <p>To maintain high availability, Oracle Clusterware components can respond to status changes to restart applications and processes according to defined high availability rules. You can use the Oracle Clusterware high availability framework by registering your applications with Oracle Clusterware and configuring the clusterware to start, stop, or relocate your application processes. That is, you can make custom applications highly available by using Oracle Clusterware to create profiles that monitor, relocate, and restart your applications.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>The Cluster Time Synchronization Service (CTSS) can detect time synchronization problems between nodes in the cluster. </p>
                  <p>CTSS is installed as part of Oracle Clusterware. It runs in <span class="italic">observer</span> mode if it detects a time synchronization service (such as NTP or Chrony) or a time synchronization service configuration, valid or broken, on the system. For example, if the <code class="codeph">etc/ntp.conf</code> file exists on any node in the cluster, then CTSS runs in observer mode even if no time synchronization software is running.
                  </p>
                  <p>If CTSS detects that there is no time synchronization service or time synchronization service configuration on <span class="italic">any</span> node in the cluster, then CTSS goes into <span class="italic">active</span> mode and takes over time management for the cluster.
                  </p>
                  <p>If CTSS is running in active mode while another, non-NTP, time synchronization software is running, then you can change CTSS to run in observer mode by creating a file called <code class="codeph">etc/ntp.conf</code>. CTSS puts an entry in the alert log about the change to observer mode.
                  </p>
                  <p>When nodes join the cluster, if CTSS is in active mode, then it compares the time on those nodes to a reference clock located on one node in the cluster. If there is a discrepancy between the two times and the discrepancy is within a certain stepping limit, then CTSS performs <span class="italic">step time synchronization</span>, which is to step the time, forward or backward, of the nodes joining the cluster to synchronize them with the reference.
                  </p>
                  <p>Clocks on nodes in the cluster become desynchronized with the reference clock (a time CTSS uses as a basis and is on the first node started in the cluster) periodically for various reasons. When this happens, CTSS performs <span class="italic">slew time synchronization</span>, which is to speed up or slow down the system time on the nodes until they are synchronized with the reference system time. In this time synchronization method, CTSS does not adjust time backward, which guarantees monotonic increase of the system time.
                  </p>
                  <p>When Oracle Clusterware starts, if CTSS is running in active mode and the time discrepancy is outside the stepping limit (the limit is 24 hours), then CTSS generates an alert in the alert log, exits, and Oracle Clusterware startup fails. You must manually adjust the time of the nodes joining the cluster to synchronize with the cluster, after which Oracle Clusterware can start and CTSS can manage the time for the nodes.</p>
                  <p>When performing slew time synchronization, CTSS never runs time backward to synchronize with the reference clock. CTSS periodically writes alerts to the alert log containing information about how often it adjusts time on nodes to keep them synchronized with the reference clock.</p>
                  <p>CTSS writes entries to the Oracle Clusterware alert log and <code class="codeph">syslog</code> when it:

                  </ul>
