            <p>A typical AutoUpgrade workflow starts with a configuration file (represented by a blue icon with the file name "config.txt", which contains information about the databases that you want to upgrade. In the graphic, that list includes: DB Name, Oracle SID, Start Time (of the upgrade), Source home, Target home, and Log Directory. There is an arrow that points to the Upgrade Bootstrap manager, which indicates that the information in the configuration file is delivered to the Manager. the Upgrade Bootstrap Manager processes configuration files, and starts the required components. There is an arrow pointing from the Upgrade Bootstrap Manager to the Upgrade Job Manager, which is the receiver of the information from the Upgrade Bootstrap Manager. The Upgrade Job Manager prepares and submits each job requested by the Upgrade Boot Manager. There is an arrow pointing from the Upgrade Job Manager to a set of rectangles, representing individual upgrade jobs. The job on top is labeled Job 100. These sets of jobs are described as follows: Each job runs under its own thread, and is isolated from the rest, so that the separate upgrade jobs can be run to maximize performance, and reduce risks. </p>
