It greatly simplifies backing up, restoring, and recovering database files.Before you perform any operations using RMAN, you must connect to a target database.The RMAN backup and recovery environment is preconfigured for each target database. The configuration is persistent and applies to all subsequent operations on this target database, even if you exit and restart RMAN.Use the BACKUP command to back up files. RMAN backs up data to the configured default device for the type of backup requested. The BACKUP command includes a host of options, parameters, and clauses that control backup output.If a database runs in ARCHIVELOG mode, then you can back up the database while it is open.If a database runs in NOARCHIVELOG mode, then the only valid database backup is a consistent backup.Incremental backups capture block-level changes to a database made after a previous incremental backup.Incrementally updated backups enable you to implement an efficient incremental forever backup strategy.RMAN validation checks a backup to determine whether it can be restored. Validation also checks for corrupt blocks and missing files.RMAN supports the use of command files to manage recurring tasks such as weekly backups.RMAN can use the information stored in the RMAN repository to generate reports on backup activities.The LIST BACKUP and LIST COPY commands display information about backups and data file copies listed in the repository.The REPORT command performs more complex reporting analysis than the LIST command.RMAN repository metadata is always stored in the control file of the target database. The RMAN maintenance commands use this metadata when managing backups.Use the CROSSCHECK command to synchronize the logical records of RMAN backups and copies with the files on storage media.The DELETE command removes RMAN backups and copies from disk and tape, updates the status of the files to DELETED in the control file repository, and removes the records from the recovery catalog (if you use a catalog).Data Recovery Advisor is an Oracle Database tool that provides an infrastructure for diagnosing persistent data failures, presenting repair options to the user, and executes repairs at the user’s request.A failure is a persistent data corruption detected by the Health Monitor. Examples include physical and logical data block corruptions and missing data files.Use the RMAN REPAIR FAILURE command to repair failures that were detected.You can use the Oracle Flashback Database to rewind the whole database to a past time. Unlike media recovery, you do not need to restore data files to return the database to a past state.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands for RMAN restore and recovery of physical database files. To recover the database because a media failure damages database files, then first ensure that you have the necessary backups. Use the RESTORE DATABASE and RECOVER DATABASE commands to recover the whole database.Use the RESTORE TABLESPACE and RECOVER TABLESPACE commands on individual tablespaces when the database is open. In this case, you must take the tablespace that needs recovery offline, restore and then recover the tablespace, and bring the recovered tablespace online.RMAN can recover individual corrupted data file blocks."> Getting Started with RMAN</a>.

                  <p>In general, the purpose of a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-7AE6D8EC-BF6C-4BE3-8A24-7137F12EBE65"><span class="xrefglossterm">backup and recovery</span></a> strategy is to protect the database against data loss and reconstruct the database after data loss.

                  </h4>
                  <div>
                     <p>As a backup administrator, your primary job is making and monitoring backups for data protection.</p>
                     <p>A <a href="glossary.html#GUID-C4F923AA-852D-4FAD-9F90-568496C1021E"><span class="xrefglossterm">backup</span></a> is a copy of data of a database that you can use to reconstruct data. A backup can be either a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-83612739-7869-4B65-B779-5C0EC11256E1"><span class="xrefglossterm">physical backup	</span></a> or a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-CB2A0AE1-8864-48BD-92FD-40CD9521CA2A"><span class="xrefglossterm">logical backup</span></a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>Physical backups are copies of the physical files used in storing and recovering a database. These files include data files, control files, and archived redo logs. Ultimately, every physical backup is a copy of files that store database information to another location, whether on disk or on offline storage media such as tape.</p>
                     <p>Logical backups contain logical data such as tables and stored procedures. You can use Oracle Data Pump to export logical data to binary files, which you can later import into the database. The Data Pump command-line clients <code class="codeph">expdp</code> and <code class="codeph">impdp</code> use the <code class="codeph">DBMS_DATAPUMP</code> and <code class="codeph">DBMS_METADATA</code> PL/SQL packages.
                     </p>
                     <p>Physical backups are the foundation of any sound backup and recovery strategy. Logical backups are a useful supplement to physical backups in many circumstances but are not sufficient protection against data loss without physical backups.</p>
                     <p>Unless otherwise specified, the term <span class="bold">backup</span> as used in the backup and recovery documentation refers to a physical backup. Backing up a database is the act of making a physical backup. The focus in the backup and recovery documentation set is almost exclusively on physical backups.
                     </p>
                     <p>Most of this manual focuses on RMAN-based backup and recovery. The most noteworthy are the following:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>

Thus, they provide more compact backups and faster recovery, thereby reducing the need to apply redo during <a href="glossary.html#GUID-01B3A956-DA97-4B47-9600-FA5549B7E868"><span class="xrefglossterm">data file media recovery</span></a>.

                           <p>RMAN uses <a href="glossary.html#GUID-65A13E9F-7391-4A6A-8379-B2EA64D0EA9E"><span class="xrefglossterm">backup encryption</span></a> capabilities integrated into Oracle Database to store backup sets in an encrypted format. To create encrypted backups on disk, the database must use the Advanced Security Option. To create encrypted backups directly on tape, RMAN must use the Oracle Secure Backup SBT interface, but does not require the Advanced Security Option.

                     <p>Whether you use RMAN or user-managed methods, you can supplement physical backups with logical backups of schema objects made with Data Pump Export utility.

If a media failure or disaster occurs, then you can restore your backups and recover lost changes.You can back up all or part of your database with the BACKUP command from within the RMAN client.You can provide arguments to the BACKUP command to override the default backup options.The BACKUP command takes a DEVICE TYPE clause that specifies whether to back up to disk or tape device.RMAN can create backups on disk as image copies or as backup sets.RMAN provides a range of options to name the files generated by the BACKUP command. When backing up to disk, you can specify a format to spread the backup across several drives for improved performance. RMAN attaches a character string called a tag to every backup it creates, as a way of identifying the backup. You can either accept the default tag or specify your own with the TAG parameter of the BACKUP command.User-specified tags are a useful way to indicate the purpose or usage of different classes of backups or copies. Use the TAG parameter with the BACKUP command to specify tags for backup sets and image copies.When creating backup sets, you can use RMAN support for binary compression of backup sets by including the AS COMPRESSED BACKUPSET option to the BACKUP command.A multisection backup enables large data files to be divided into sections that can be backed up in parallel across multiple channels. This provides faster backup performance and better recovery times.While an image copy is being created, RMAN uses multiple channels to write files sections. However, the output of this operation is one copy for each data file.You can perform a whole database backup with the database mounted or open. You can back up one or more tablespaces with the BACKUP TABLESPACE command or one or more data files with the BACKUP DATAFILE command. You can back up the control file when the database is mounted or open. RMAN uses a snapshot control file to ensure a read-consistent version. A manual backup of the control file is different from a control file autobackup. RMAN makes a control file autobackup after the files specified in the BACKUP command are backed up. To make a manual backup, you can either specify INCLUDE CURRENT CONTROLFILE when backing up other files or specify BACKUP CURRENT CONTROLFILE. RMAN automatically backs up the current server parameter file in certain cases. The BACKUP SPFILE command backs up the parameter file explicitly. The server parameter file that is backed up is the one currently in use by the instance. You can only back up a database in NOARCHIVELOG mode when the database is closed and in a consistent state.Preplugin backups ensure that an RMAN backup is usable after a non-CDB is plugged in as a PDB into a CDB. Use the BACKUP command to back up multitenant container databases (CDBs) and pluggable databases (PDBs).RMAN and Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control provide full support for backup and recovery in a multitenant environment.Backing up a whole multitenant container database (CDB) is similar to backing up a non-CDB. When you back up a whole CDB, RMAN backs up the root, all the pluggable databases (PDBs), and the archived redo logs.You can use RMAN to make a backup of only the root. Because the root contains critical metadata for the whole CDB, Oracle recommends that you back up the root or back up the whole CDB at regular intervals.Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) can be used to back up the root.RMAN enables you to back up one or more PDBs in a CDB using the BACKUP command. Preplugin backups of a PDB can be used to perform restore and recover operations after the PDB is migrated and plugged in to a different destination CDB.Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) can be used to perform backups of pluggable databases (PDBs).Because tablespaces in different PDBs can have the same name, to eliminate ambiguity you must connect directly to a PDB to back up one or more of its tablespaces.This example creates a preplugin backup of the PDB my_pdb that is contained in CDB cdb_prod. The CDB uses shared undo and is open in read-write mode.RMAN enables you to use the BACKUP command to perform backup operations on the application root, one or more application PDBs, and the application container.RMAN can back up application containers, application PDBs, and the application root.Use the RMAN BACKUP command to back up the application root.Use the BACKUP command to back up an application container, which consists of the application root and all the application PDBs that belong to the application root.The BACKUP command is used to back up one or more application PDBs. Use the BACKUP command to back up sparse databases.RMAN enables you to back up a sparse database, using steps similar to backing up a whole database, in the backup set or image copy format.You can back up one or more tablespaces containing sparse data files or individual sparse data files using the BACKUP command. RMAN enables you to back up one or more sparse PDBs in a CDB. Archived redo logs are the key to successful media recovery. You should back them up regularly.Several features of RMAN backups are specific to archived redo logs. For example, you can use BACKUP ... DELETE to delete one or all copies of archived redo logs from disk after backing them up to backup sets. Even if your redo logs are being archived to multiple destinations and you use RMAN to back up archived redo logs, RMAN selects only one copy of the archived redo log file to include in the backup set. Because logs with the same log sequence number are identical, RMAN does not need to include more than one log copy.Automatic online redo log switching is an important RMAN feature. In a CDB, archived redo logs can be backed up only when you connect to the root as a common user with the SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP privilege. To back up archived logs, use the BACKUP ARCHIVELOG command.You can indicate that RMAN should automatically skip backups of archived redo logs.You can back up archived redo logs in a multitenant container database (CDB) by using the BACKUP ARCHIVELOG command.The BACKUP ARCHIVELOG ... DELETE INPUT command deletes archived log files after they are backed up. This command eliminates the separate step of manually deleting archived redo logs. In a CDB, you can delete archived redo logs after they are backed up by using the BACKUP ARCHIVELOG ... DELETE INPUT command.An incremental backup copies only data file blocks that have changed since a specified previous backup. Use the BACKUP command to create incremental backups.RMAN incremental backups provide multiple benefits.Choose a backup strategy according to an acceptable MTTR (mean time to recover). You can use the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) with the Oracle VSS writer to make a shadow copy or snapshot of files in a database.By incrementally updating backups, you can avoid the overhead of making full image copy backups of data files, while also minimizing time required for media recovery of your database. For example, if you run a daily backup script, then you never have more than 1 day of redo to apply for media recovery.To create incremental backups for use in an incrementally updated backup strategy, use the BACKUP ... FOR RECOVER OF COPY WITH TAG form of the BACKUP command. The command is best understood in a sample script that implements the strategy.The block change tracking feature for incremental backups improves backup performance by recording changed blocks for each data file.If block change tracking is enabled on a primary or standby database, then RMAN uses a block change tracking file to identify changed blocks for incremental backups. By reading this small bitmap file to determine which blocks changed, RMAN avoids having to scan every block in the data file that it is backing up.Oracle Database automatically manages space in the change tracking file to retain block change data that covers the eight most recent backups. After the maximum of eight bitmaps is reached, the oldest bitmap is overwritten by the bitmap that tracks the current changes.By default, the block change tracking file is created as an Oracle managed file in the destination specified by the DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST initialization parameter. You can also place the block change tracking file in any location that you choose, by specifying its name when enabling block change tracking. The size of the block change tracking file is proportional to the size of the database and the number of enabled threads of redo. You can enable block change tracking when the database is either open or mounted. When you disable block change tracking, the database removes the block change tracking file from the operating system.You can query the V$BLOCK_CHANGE_TRACKING view to determine whether change tracking is enabled, and if it is, the file name of the block change tracking file.To move the change tracking file, use the ALTER DATABASE RENAME FILE statement. You can use BACKUP... KEEP to create a backup that is both all-inclusive and exempt from the backup retention policy.You can exempt a backup from the retention policy by using the KEEP option with the BACKUP command. Typically, you make an archival backup to tape. Because your data protection backups are most likely to be on a set of tapes that remain accessible and are recycled, it is advisable to reserve a set of tapes for the archival backup. Use the BACKUP command with the KEEP option to make archival backups.One purpose of an archival backup is to create a test database. You can use the BACKUP BACKUPSET command to back up backup sets produced by other backup jobs. You can also use BACKUP RECOVERY AREA to back up recovery files created in the current and all previous fast recovery area destinations. The BACKUP BACKUPSET command creates additional copies of backup pieces in a backup set, but does not create a new backup set. For a backup retention policy based on redundancy, a backup set is counted as one instance of a backup. This statement is true even if there are multiple copies of the backup pieces that form the backup set, such as when a backup set has been backed up from disk to tape.Use the BACKUP BACKUPSET command to copy backup sets from disk to tape. Use the BACKUP command to back up image copies to tape."> Backing Up the Database</a></p>

                     <p>Although several problems can halt the normal operation of an Oracle Database or affect database I/O operations, not all of them require DBA intervention.</p>
                     <p>The following problems typically require DBA intervention and data recovery: <a href="glossary.html#GUID-ABDE7EEF-D4B3-4867-A69C-3B24614AF430"><span class="xrefglossterm">media failure</span></a>, user errors, and application errors. Other failures may require DBA intervention without causing data loss or requiring recovery from backup. For example, you may need to restart the database after an instance failure or allocate more disk space after statement failure because of a full data file.

                        <p>A media failure is a physical problem with a disk that causes a failure of a read from or write to a disk file that is required to run the database. Any database file can be vulnerable to a media failure. The appropriate recovery technique following a media failure depends on the files affected and the types of backup available.</p>
                        <p>One particularly important aspect of backup and recovery is developing a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-641AA42A-EAFE-449E-99D9-55DCBAE6539D"><span class="xrefglossterm">disaster recovery</span></a> strategy to protect against catastrophic data loss, for example, the loss of an entire database host.

                        <p>User errors occur when, either due to an error in application logic or a manual mistake, data in a database is changed or deleted incorrectly. User errors are estimated to be the greatest single cause of database downtime.</p>

                     <p>The logical-level flashback features of Oracle Database do not depend on RMAN and are available whether or not RMAN is part of your backup strategy.</p>
                     <p>Most of the flashback features of Oracle operate at the logical level, enabling you to view and manipulate database objects. Except for Oracle Flashback Drop, the logical flashback features rely on <strong class="term">undo data</strong>, which are records of the effects of each database update and the values overwritten in the update.
                     </p>
                     <p>Oracle Database includes the following logical flashback features:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">

                           <p>You can specify a target time and run queries against a database, viewing results as they would appear at the target time. To recover from an unwanted change like an update to a table, you could choose a target time before the error and run a query to retrieve the contents of the lost rows. <a href="../adfns/flashback.html#ADFNS1008" target="_blank"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Development Guide</span></a> explains how to use this feature.

                           <p>You can view all versions of all rows that ever existed in one or more tables in a specified time interval. You can also retrieve metadata about the differing versions of the rows, including start and end time, operation, and transaction ID of the transaction that created the version. You can use this feature to recover lost data values and to audit changes to the tables queried. <a href="../adfns/flashback.html#ADFNS1008" target="_blank"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Development Guide</span></a> explains how to use this feature.

                           <p>You can reverse a transaction. Oracle Database determines the dependencies between transactions and in effect creates a compensating transaction that reverses the unwanted changes. The database rewinds to a state as if the transaction, and any transactions that could be dependent on it, had never happened. <a href="../adfns/flashback.html#ADFNS1008" target="_blank"><span class="italic">Oracle Database Development Guide</span></a> explains how to use this feature.

                           <p>You can recover a table or set of tables to a specified point in time earlier without taking any part of the database offline. In many cases, Flashback Table eliminates the need to perform more complicated point-in-time recovery operations. Flashback Table restores tables while automatically maintaining associated attributes such as current indexes, triggers, and constraints, and in this way enabling you to avoid finding and restoring database-specific properties. <span class="q">"<a href="rman-performing-flashback-dbpitr.html#GUID-FF315DFC-ABBC-410D-ABDB-75FA89D43255" title="Flashback Table uses information in the undo tablespace rather than restored backups to retrieve the table.

A flashback data archive consists of one or more tablespaces or parts of tablespaces. When you create a flashback data archive, you specify the name, retention period, and tablespace. You can also specify a default flashback data archive. The database automatically purges old historical data the day after the retention period expires.

To recover PDBs, you must connect to the root as a user with SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP privilege. After recovery, old backups of the PDB remain valid and can be used if a media failure occurs.The flashback features of the Oracle Database are more efficient than media recovery in most circumstances in which they are available. You can use them to investigate past states of the database.Oracle Flashback Database is the most efficient alternative to DBPITR.Logical flashback features are used to recover tables and their contents to a past time.You can perform a Flashback Database operation for a whole multitenant container database (CDB) or for a particular pluggable database (PDB). A multitenant container database (CDB) can use shared undo or local undo. The technique used by RMAN to perform flashback database operations depends on the type of undo configuration for the CDB.RMAN provides methods to manage redo corruption to data blocks in a PDB.Flashback Table uses information in the undo tablespace rather than restored backups to retrieve the table. When a Flashback Table operation occurs, new rows are deleted and old rows are reinserted. The rest of your database remains available while the flashback of the table is being performed.To perform a Flashback Table operation, the table must be eligible to be flashed back and the user performing the operation must have the required privileges.To use the Flashback Table feature on one or more tables, use the FLASHBACK TABLE SQL statement with a target time or SCN.By default, the database disables triggers on the affected table before performing a FLASHBACK TABLE operation. After the operation, the database returns the triggers to the state they were in before the operation (enabled or disabled). You can retrieve objects from the recycle bin with the FLASHBACK TABLE ... TO BEFORE DROP statement.Flashback Drop reverses the effects of a DROP TABLE operation. Flashback Drop is faster than other recovery mechanisms that can be used in this situation, such as point-in-time recovery, and does not lead to downtime or loss of recent transactions.Prerequisites must be met before you perform a Flashback Drop operation.Use the FLASHBACK TABLE ... TO BEFORE DROP statement to recover objects from the recycle bin. You can specify either the name of the table in the recycle bin or the original table name.You can create, and then drop, several objects with the same original name. All dropped objects are stored in the recycle bin.Flashback Database reverses unwanted changes by returning your database to its state at a previous point in time.Flashback Database works by undoing changes to the data files that exist at the moment that you run the command. Prerequisites must be met to perform a Flashback Database operation.A Flashback Database operation uses the FLASHBACK DATABASE command to rewind the database to a past point in time.You can perform a flashback database operation for a whole multitenant container database (CDB) using the FLASHBACK DATABASE command.You can perform a flashback database operation for a single pluggable database (PDB) in a multitenant container database (CDB) using the FLASHBACK DATABASE command.Data dictionary views contain information that is used to monitor flashback database.RMAN DBPITR restores the database from backups before the target time for recovery, then uses incremental backups and redo to roll the database forward to the target time. You can recover to an SCN, time, log sequence number, or restore point. Oracle recommends that you create restore points at important times to make point-in-time recovery more manageable if it ever becomes necessary.Certain prerequisites must be met to perform database point-in-time recovery (DBPITR).Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform DBPITR.Use the RECOVER command to perform point-in-time recovery (PITR) of container databases (CDBs) and pluggable databases (PDBs). PITR of PDBs can only be performed using RMAN.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform point-in-time recovery for a whole CDB.When you recover one or more PDBs to a specified point-in-time, the remaining PDBs in the CDB are not affected and they can be open and operational. Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform point-in-time recovery of an application PDB.Performing point-in-time recovery of sparse databases is similar to performing point-in-time recovery of normal databases. This section describes variations of the basic Flashback Database and DBPITR scenarios.Flashback Database can be used to undo an OPEN RESETLOGS operation.Flashback Database across OPEN RESETLOGS may be used to perform multiple functions in a Data Guard environment.You can use Flashback Database to rewind a database to an abandoned database incarnation.To perform DPITR to an noncurrent database incarnation, you must explicitly execute the RESET DATABASE to reset the database to the incarnation that was current at the target SCN. You must also restore a control file from the database incarnation containing the target SCN."> Performing Flashback and Database Point-in-Time Recovery</a> to learn how to perform Flashback Table and Flashback Drop

The end product is much like the result of a DBPITR, but is generally much faster because it does not require restoring data files from backup and requires less redo than media recovery.
                     </p>
                     <p>Flashback Database uses <a href="glossary.html#GUID-725ED3D7-5077-4F16-85AA-CDAD5BFCE554"><span class="xrefglossterm">flashback logs</span></a> to access past versions of data blocks and some information from archived redo logs.

Flashback logging is not enabled by default. Space used for flashback logs is managed automatically by the database and balanced against space required for other files in the fast recovery area.

For Data Recovery Advisor, a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-046A9407-B78B-4BBA-BE2F-55D74EF4F2D8"><span class="xrefglossterm">failure</span></a> is a persistent data corruption that can be directly mapped to a set of repair actions. Each failure has a status of open or closed. Each failure also has a priority of critical, high, or low.
                  </p>
                  <p>Failures are detected by data integrity checks, which are diagnostic procedures executed to assess the health of the database or its components. If a <a href="glossary.html#GUID-AECF0DB7-EEF4-4676-9978-42F0B5F9F9DE"><span class="xrefglossterm">data integrity check</span></a> reveals a failure, then Data Recovery Advisor automatically assesses the effect of a set of failures and maps it to a set of repair options. Usually, Data Recovery Advisor presents both automated and manual repair options.
                  </p>
                  <p>Data Recovery Advisor determines the best automated repair option and its effect on the database. The <a href="glossary.html#GUID-76EA30CA-A51E-44C9-AB25-E1D89AF711B2"><span class="xrefglossterm">repair option</span></a> may include repairs such as data file restore and recovery, media recovery, Flashback Database, and so on. Before presenting an automated repair option, Data Recovery Advisor validates it for the specific environment and the availability of media components required to complete the proposed repair.
                  </p>
                  <p>If you choose an automated repair option, then RMAN coordinates sessions on the Oracle Database to perform the <a href="glossary.html#GUID-021686F4-9813-468B-A83E-9E7773FD4D4C"><span class="xrefglossterm">repair</span></a> for you.

The GUI interface is available in Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control.A checker is a diagnostic operation or procedure registered with the Health Monitor to assess the health of the database or its components. A failure is a persistent data corruption that is detected by a data integrity check.Every failure has a failure status: OPEN or CLOSED. Every failure has a failure priority: CRITICAL, HIGH, or LOW. Data Recovery Advisor only assigns CRITICAL or HIGH priority to diagnosed failures.For clarity, Data Recovery Advisor groups related failures together. The ADVISE FAILURE command can present both manual and automatic repair options. Data Recovery Advisor categorizes manual actions as either mandatory or optional.When possible, Data Recovery Advisor consolidates repairs to fix multiple failures into a single repair. A consolidated repair may contain multiple steps.Whenever Data Recovery Advisor generates an automated repair option, it creates a script that explains which commands RMAN intends to use to repair the failure. Data Recovery Advisor prints the location of this script, which is a text file residing on the operating system. Data Recovery Advisor is supported only on some database configurations.Data Recovery Advisor only supports single-instance databases. Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) databases are not supported.There are some limitations with Data Recovery Advisor in an Oracle Data Guard environment.Data Recovery Advisor can only be used to diagnose and repair data corruptions in non-CDBs and the root of a multitenant container database (CDB). Data Recovery Advisor is not supported for pluggable databases (PDBs).The Data Recovery Advisor workflow begins when you either suspect or discover a failure. You can discover failures in many ways, including error messages, alerts, trace files, and failed data integrity checks.You can use the Data Recovery Advisor to automatically diagnose data failures, determine appropriate repair options, and execute repairs in a CDB. If you suspect or know that one or more database failures have occurred, then use LIST FAILURE to obtain information about them.The easiest way to determine problems that your database is encountering is to use the LIST FAILURE command. Besides providing more verbose output, LIST FAILURE also enables you to restrict output.The database invokes data integrity checks reactively when a user transaction is trying to access corrupted data. In some cases, latent failures can go undetected. Use the ADVISE FAILURE command to display repair options after running LIST FAILURE in an RMAN session. This command prints a summary of the failures and implicitly closes all open failures that are repaired.If one or more failures exist, then you typically use LIST FAILURE to show information about the failures and then ADVISE FAILURE in the same RMAN session to obtain a report of your repair options.You can also request repair options for specific failures. You can specify failures by status (CRITICAL, HIGH, or LOW) or by failure number. You can also use EXCLUDE FAILURE to exclude one or more failures from the report.You can use Data Recovery Advisor to repair failures automatically.If ADVISE FAILURE suggests manual repairs, then try these first. If manual repairs are not possible, or if they do not repair all failures, then you can use REPAIR FAILURE to automatically fix failures suggested in the most recent ADVISE FAILURE command in your current RMAN session.By default the script is displayed to standard output. You can use the SPOOL command to write the script to an editable file.In some situations, you may want to use the CHANGE FAILURE command to alter the status or priority of a failure."> Diagnosing and Repairing Failures with Data Recovery Advisor</a>, to learn how to use Data Recovery Advisor

                     <p>Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) is a browser-based management interface for Oracle Database. </p>
                     <p>Cloud Control provides a graphical front end and scheduling facilities for RMAN. You enter job parameters, specify a job schedule, and Cloud Control runs RMAN at the designated time or designated repeat interval to conduct the backup and recovery operations. Cloud Control provides access to RMAN through a set of wizards. These wizards lead you through a variety of recovery procedures based on an analysis of your database, your available backups, and your data recovery objectives.</p>
                     <p>By using Cloud Control, you can perform the simpler restore and recovery scenarios outlined in this documentation. You can also use more sophisticated restore and recovery techniques such as point-in-time recovery and Oracle Flashback operations, which allow for efficient repair of media failures and user errors. Using Cloud Control is often simpler than the RMAN command-line client.</p>

                  <p>Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance) is a cloud-scale Engineered System that is designed to protect all the Oracle Databases in your enterprise. It achieves significant efficiencies in performance and manageability of backups by offloading most Oracle Database backup and restore processing to a centralized Recovery Appliance.</p>
                  <p>Recovery Appliance stores and manages backups of multiple databases on a unified disk pool, using an incremental-forever backup strategy described in <span class="q">"<a href="rman-backup-concepts.html#GUID-819CED6A-55E4-4606-BCA4-3B395FCD30C6" title="The incremental-forever backup strategy eliminates the need for creating recurring full backups when backing up to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance).

                  <p>Multiple client databases—known as protected databases—share a single, centrally-managed Recovery Appliance catalog that resides on the Recovery Appliance. All protected databases that send backups to Recovery Appliance must use this catalog. Virtual private catalog technology enforces separation of duties among the protected database DBAs and the Recovery Appliance administrator.</p>
                  <p>Real-time redo transport minimizes the window of potential data loss that exists between successive archived log backups. Redo data from the protected database is written directly to the recovery appliance as it is generated.</p>
                  <p>Recovery Appliance is integrated with Cloud Control and RMAN. An accompanying media management library is used for communication between RMAN and Recovery Appliance. Cloud Control enables administrators to centrally manage and monitor the data protection of all protected databases in the enterprise.</p>
                  <p>Oracle Secure Backup, the tape management component of Recovery Appliance, is preinstalled on Recovery Appliance. For disaster recovery, Recovery Appliance can replicate backups to other Recovery Appliances. A single Recovery Appliance can service multiple protected databases of different versions and from different platforms.</p>

                     <p>This section provides a roadmap for navigating the backup and recovery documentation when using RMAN as your principal backup and recovery solution.</p>
                     <p>Begin by reading <span class="q">"<a href="getting-started-rman.html#GUID-871FF5B2-C82B-462E-8182-FA28CF7B3E3B" title="Recovery Manager (RMAN) is an Oracle Database client that performs backup and recovery tasks on your databases and automates administration of your backup strategies. It greatly simplifies backing up, restoring, and recovering database files.Before you perform any operations using RMAN, you must connect to a target database.The RMAN backup and recovery environment is preconfigured for each target database. The configuration is persistent and applies to all subsequent operations on this target database, even if you exit and restart RMAN.Use the BACKUP command to back up files. RMAN backs up data to the configured default device for the type of backup requested. The BACKUP command includes a host of options, parameters, and clauses that control backup output.If a database runs in ARCHIVELOG mode, then you can back up the database while it is open.If a database runs in NOARCHIVELOG mode, then the only valid database backup is a consistent backup.Incremental backups capture block-level changes to a database made after a previous incremental backup.Incrementally updated backups enable you to implement an efficient incremental forever backup strategy.RMAN validation checks a backup to determine whether it can be restored. Validation also checks for corrupt blocks and missing files.RMAN supports the use of command files to manage recurring tasks such as weekly backups.RMAN can use the information stored in the RMAN repository to generate reports on backup activities.The LIST BACKUP and LIST COPY commands display information about backups and data file copies listed in the repository.The REPORT command performs more complex reporting analysis than the LIST command.RMAN repository metadata is always stored in the control file of the target database. The RMAN maintenance commands use this metadata when managing backups.Use the CROSSCHECK command to synchronize the logical records of RMAN backups and copies with the files on storage media.The DELETE command removes RMAN backups and copies from disk and tape, updates the status of the files to DELETED in the control file repository, and removes the records from the recovery catalog (if you use a catalog).Data Recovery Advisor is an Oracle Database tool that provides an infrastructure for diagnosing persistent data failures, presenting repair options to the user, and executes repairs at the user’s request.A failure is a persistent data corruption detected by the Health Monitor. Examples include physical and logical data block corruptions and missing data files.Use the RMAN REPAIR FAILURE command to repair failures that were detected.You can use the Oracle Flashback Database to rewind the whole database to a past time. Unlike media recovery, you do not need to restore data files to return the database to a past state.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands for RMAN restore and recovery of physical database files. To recover the database because a media failure damages database files, then first ensure that you have the necessary backups. Use the RESTORE DATABASE and RECOVER DATABASE commands to recover the whole database.Use the RESTORE TABLESPACE and RECOVER TABLESPACE commands on individual tablespaces when the database is open. In this case, you must take the tablespace that needs recovery offline, restore and then recover the tablespace, and bring the recovered tablespace online.RMAN can recover individual corrupted data file blocks.">Getting Started with RMAN</a>"</span>. This brief chapter, which explains the most basic RMAN techniques, may be adequate for your purposes.

For example, the RMAN client on Linux is located in $ORACLE_HOME/bin.You can create database connections from the RMAN client or the operating system command line. These database connection can be authenticated using a password file or with operating system authentication.To perform useful work, the RMAN client must connect to a database.Users connecting with RMAN to a target or auxiliary database require either the SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP system privilege. RMAN connections to a target or auxiliary database can be made using operating system authentication.Use a password file for either local or remote access. If a database uses a password file to authenticate administrative users, then RMAN can connect using a password.If you start RMAN without a connect string on the operating system command line, then you must issue a CONNECT TARGET command at the RMAN prompt to connect to a target database.To connect to a target database from the operating system command line, enter the rman command followed by the connection information. You can begin executing commands after the RMAN prompt is displayed.You can connect the RMAN client to multitenant container databases (CDBs) and pluggable databases (PDBs).You can perform RMAN operations on a whole CDB, the root only, or one or more PDBs. Certain restrictions apply when you connect directly to a pluggable database (PDB):There are several ways to connect as target to the root. You can connect to a PDB either from the RMAN prompt or the operating system command line.You can make a database connection by creating an RMAN command file containing a CONNECT command..To use the DUPLICATE command, you must connect to an auxiliary instance. Performing tablespace point-in-time recovery (TSPITR) may also require a connection to an auxiliary instance.When you are diagnosing errors that RMAN encounters in connecting to the target, catalog and auxiliary databases, consider using SQL*Plus to connect to the databases directly. This action can reveal underlying problems with the connection information or the databases.RMAN connects to target and auxiliary databases using the SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP privilege. Thus, when you use SQL*Plus to diagnose connection problems to the target or auxiliary databases, request a SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP connection to reproduce RMAN behavior.Use SQL*Plus to diagnose recovery catalog connection problems.By default, RMAN writes command output to standard output. To redirect output to a log file, enter the LOG parameter on the command line when you start RMAN.Before invoking RMAN, it may be useful to set the NLS_DATE_FORMAT and NLS_LANG environment variables. These variables determine the format used for the time parameters in RMAN commands such as RESTORE, RECOVER, and REPORT.When the RMAN client is ready for your commands, it displays the command promptFor repetitive tasks, you can create a text file containing RMAN commands, and start the RMAN client with the @ argument, followed by a file name.The comment character in RMAN is a pound sign (#). All text from the pound sign to the end of the line is ignored. When running a command file, you can specify one or more values in a USING clause for use in substitution variables in a command file. In this way, you can make your command files dynamic.You can test RMAN commands for syntactic correctness without executing them. Use the command-line argument CHECKSYNTAX to start the RMAN client in a mode in which it only parses the commands that you enter and returns an RMAN-00558 error for commands that are not legal RMAN syntax.You can check the syntax of RMAN commands interactively without actually executing the commands.To test commands in a command file, start RMAN with the CHECKSYNTAX parameter and use the @ command to name the command file to be passed.The RMAN pipe interface is an alternative method for issuing commands to RMAN and receiving the output from those commands. Using this interface, it is possible to write a portable programmatic interface to RMAN.This example assumes that the application controlling RMAN wants to run multiple commands in succession. After each command is sent down the pipe and executed and the output returned, RMAN pauses and waits for the next command.This example assumes that the application controlling RMAN wants to run one or more commands as a single job. After running the commands that are on the pipe, RMAN exits."> Starting and Interacting with the RMAN&nbsp;Client</a>"</span>.

You can modify the value of default parameters or override these values for a particular session.You can use the SHOW command to display the current value of RMAN configured settings for the target database. You can also view whether these commands are currently set to their default values.Backups for which no destination device type is specified are directed to the configured default device. RMAN is preconfigured to use disk as the default device type. No additional configuration is necessary.The BACKUP command can create either backup sets or image copies. For disk, you can configure RMAN to create either backup sets or image copies as its default backup type with the CONFIGURE DEVICE TYPE DISK BACKUP TYPE TO command. An RMAN channel is a connection to a database server session. RMAN uses channels to perform most tasks.Use the CONFIGURE CHANNEL command to configure options for disk or SBT channels. You can configure generic channel settings for a device type, that is, a template that is used for any channels created based on configured settings for that device.By default, RMAN allocates one disk channel for all operations. You can specify different options for this channel, for example, a new default location for backups.The number of channels available for a device type when you run a command determines whether RMAN reads or writes in parallel. As a rule, the number of channels used in executing a command should match the number of devices accessed. If you manually allocate a channel during a job, then RMAN disregards any configured channel settings.You can configure RMAN to automatically back up the control file and server parameter file. The autobackup occurs whenever a backup record is added.By default, the format of the autobackup file for all configured devices is the substitution variable %F in the FORMAT clause.The SET CONTROLFILE AUTOBACKUP FORMAT command, which you can specify either within a RUN command or at the RMAN prompt, overrides the configured autobackup format in the current session only. On most platforms, to back up to and restore from sequential media such as tape you must integrate a media management software with your Oracle database. You can use Oracle Secure Backup, which supports both database and file system backups to tape, as your media manager. Before attempting to use RMAN with a media manager, determine the location of the media management library. After installing the media management software, perform the configuration required by your vendor so that the software can accept RMAN backups. After you have confirmed that the database server can load the media management library, test to ensure that RMAN can back up to the media manager. The ALLOCATE CHANNEL command is used to perform a basic test of RMAN communication with the media manager.After testing a channel allocation on the media manager, create and restore a test backup.Configuring SBT channels creates a persistent setting that is the default used for backup and recovery operations with a media manager.A backup piece name is determined by the FORMAT string specified in the BACKUP command, CONFIGURE CHANNEL command, or ALLOCATECHANNEL command.The easiest technique for backing up to a media manager is to configure automatic SBT channelsRMAN commands can be used to back up target databases to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance). Certain configuration steps are required to use the Recovery Appliance as a centralized repository for the target database backups.Before you can use RMAN to back up a target database to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance), you must install the Recovery Appliance backup module in the Oracle home of the target database.RMAN configuration is required before you can back up Oracle databases to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance).Before using RMAN to back up target databases to Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance), you need to determine the location of the Recovery Appliance backup module on the target database host. This location is used while configuring or allocating RMAN channels for Recovery Appliance.The client configuration file, stored on the protected database, contains the configuration settings that are used by the Zero Data Loss Recovery Appliance (Recovery Appliance) backup module to communicate with the Recovery Appliance. This file is created automatically when the Recovery Appliance backup module is installed.The fast recovery area feature enables you to set up a disk area where the database can create and manage a variety of files related to backup and recovery. Use of the fast recovery area is strongly recommended. Consider configuring a fast recovery area as a first step in implementing a backup strategy.The fast recovery area can contain control files, online redo logs, archived redo logs, flashback logs, and RMAN backups. The fast recovery area can be used with Oracle Managed Files (OMF) and Automatic Storage Management (ASM)Space in the fast recovery area is balanced among backups and archived logs that must be kept according to the retention policy, and other files that may be subject to deletion. You enable the fast recovery area by setting two initialization parameters. These parameters enable the fast recovery area with or without having to shut down and restart the database instance.The larger the fast recovery area is, the more useful it becomes. Ideally, the fast recovery area is large enough to contain the control files, online redo logs, archived redo logs, and flashback logs. It should be able to contain a copy of all data files in the database and the incremental backups used by your chosen backup strategy.Use database initialization parameters to set the location and size of the fast recovery area.You can use the ALTER SYSTEM command to disable the fast recovery area.Use initialization parameters to configure the default locations for control files and redo logs. The initialization parameters CONTROL_FILES, DB_CREATE_ONLINE_LOG_DEST_n, DB_RECOVERY_FILE_DEST, and DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST all interact to determine the location where the database control files are created.Oracle recommends that you the use fast recovery area as an archiving location because the archived logs are automatically managed by the database. Certain RMAN commands or implicit actions (such as control file autobackups) can create files in the fast recovery area. The backup retention policy specifies which backups must be retained to meet your data recovery requirements.The REDUNDANCY parameter of the CONFIGURE RETENTION POLICY command specifies how many full or level 0 backups of each data file and control file that RMAN keeps. The default retention policy is REDUNDANCY 1.The RECOVERY WINDOW parameter of the CONFIGURE command specifies the number of days between the current time and the earliest point of recoverability.When you disable the retention policy, RMAN does not consider any backup as obsolete.Run the RMAN CONFIGURE command to enable and disable backup optimization. Backup optimization skips the backup of files in certain circumstances if the identical file or an identical version of the file has been backed up.When you enable backup optimization, the BACKUP command skips backing up files when the identical file has been backed up to the specified device type.Backup optimization is not always applied when backing up to SBT devices.By default, backup optimization is configured to OFF. You can use the SHOW BACKUP OPTIMIZATION command to view the current settings of backup optimization.You can use RMAN to create a persistent configuration that governs when archived redo logs are eligible for deletion from disk.You can use the CONFIGURE ARCHIVELOG DELETION POLICY command to specify when archived redo logs are eligible for deletion.By default, there is no archived redo log deletion policy and this is why the archive redo log policy is set to the NONE clause.You can use the CONFIGURE ARCHIVELOG DELETION POLICY BACKED UP integer TIMES TO DEVICE TYPE command to enable an archived log deletion policy. This configuration specifies that archived logs are eligible for deletion only when the specified number of archived log backups exist on the specified device type.By default the archived redo log deletion policy is set to NONE.If you use RMAN in a Data Guard environment, then you can use the CONFIGURE command to register and configure settings for the physical databases in this environment."> Configuring the RMAN Environment</a>"</span>.

If a media failure or disaster occurs, then you can restore your backups and recover lost changes.You can back up all or part of your database with the BACKUP command from within the RMAN client.You can provide arguments to the BACKUP command to override the default backup options.The BACKUP command takes a DEVICE TYPE clause that specifies whether to back up to disk or tape device.RMAN can create backups on disk as image copies or as backup sets.RMAN provides a range of options to name the files generated by the BACKUP command. When backing up to disk, you can specify a format to spread the backup across several drives for improved performance. RMAN attaches a character string called a tag to every backup it creates, as a way of identifying the backup. You can either accept the default tag or specify your own with the TAG parameter of the BACKUP command.User-specified tags are a useful way to indicate the purpose or usage of different classes of backups or copies. Use the TAG parameter with the BACKUP command to specify tags for backup sets and image copies.When creating backup sets, you can use RMAN support for binary compression of backup sets by including the AS COMPRESSED BACKUPSET option to the BACKUP command.A multisection backup enables large data files to be divided into sections that can be backed up in parallel across multiple channels. This provides faster backup performance and better recovery times.While an image copy is being created, RMAN uses multiple channels to write files sections. However, the output of this operation is one copy for each data file.You can perform a whole database backup with the database mounted or open. You can back up one or more tablespaces with the BACKUP TABLESPACE command or one or more data files with the BACKUP DATAFILE command. You can back up the control file when the database is mounted or open. RMAN uses a snapshot control file to ensure a read-consistent version. A manual backup of the control file is different from a control file autobackup. RMAN makes a control file autobackup after the files specified in the BACKUP command are backed up. To make a manual backup, you can either specify INCLUDE CURRENT CONTROLFILE when backing up other files or specify BACKUP CURRENT CONTROLFILE. RMAN automatically backs up the current server parameter file in certain cases. The BACKUP SPFILE command backs up the parameter file explicitly. The server parameter file that is backed up is the one currently in use by the instance. You can only back up a database in NOARCHIVELOG mode when the database is closed and in a consistent state.Preplugin backups ensure that an RMAN backup is usable after a non-CDB is plugged in as a PDB into a CDB. Use the BACKUP command to back up multitenant container databases (CDBs) and pluggable databases (PDBs).RMAN and Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control provide full support for backup and recovery in a multitenant environment.Backing up a whole multitenant container database (CDB) is similar to backing up a non-CDB. When you back up a whole CDB, RMAN backs up the root, all the pluggable databases (PDBs), and the archived redo logs.You can use RMAN to make a backup of only the root. Because the root contains critical metadata for the whole CDB, Oracle recommends that you back up the root or back up the whole CDB at regular intervals.Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) can be used to back up the root.RMAN enables you to back up one or more PDBs in a CDB using the BACKUP command. Preplugin backups of a PDB can be used to perform restore and recover operations after the PDB is migrated and plugged in to a different destination CDB.Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) can be used to perform backups of pluggable databases (PDBs).Because tablespaces in different PDBs can have the same name, to eliminate ambiguity you must connect directly to a PDB to back up one or more of its tablespaces.This example creates a preplugin backup of the PDB my_pdb that is contained in CDB cdb_prod. The CDB uses shared undo and is open in read-write mode.RMAN enables you to use the BACKUP command to perform backup operations on the application root, one or more application PDBs, and the application container.RMAN can back up application containers, application PDBs, and the application root.Use the RMAN BACKUP command to back up the application root.Use the BACKUP command to back up an application container, which consists of the application root and all the application PDBs that belong to the application root.The BACKUP command is used to back up one or more application PDBs. Use the BACKUP command to back up sparse databases.RMAN enables you to back up a sparse database, using steps similar to backing up a whole database, in the backup set or image copy format.You can back up one or more tablespaces containing sparse data files or individual sparse data files using the BACKUP command. RMAN enables you to back up one or more sparse PDBs in a CDB. Archived redo logs are the key to successful media recovery. You should back them up regularly.Several features of RMAN backups are specific to archived redo logs. For example, you can use BACKUP ... DELETE to delete one or all copies of archived redo logs from disk after backing them up to backup sets. Even if your redo logs are being archived to multiple destinations and you use RMAN to back up archived redo logs, RMAN selects only one copy of the archived redo log file to include in the backup set. Because logs with the same log sequence number are identical, RMAN does not need to include more than one log copy.Automatic online redo log switching is an important RMAN feature. In a CDB, archived redo logs can be backed up only when you connect to the root as a common user with the SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP privilege. To back up archived logs, use the BACKUP ARCHIVELOG command.You can indicate that RMAN should automatically skip backups of archived redo logs.You can back up archived redo logs in a multitenant container database (CDB) by using the BACKUP ARCHIVELOG command.The BACKUP ARCHIVELOG ... DELETE INPUT command deletes archived log files after they are backed up. This command eliminates the separate step of manually deleting archived redo logs. In a CDB, you can delete archived redo logs after they are backed up by using the BACKUP ARCHIVELOG ... DELETE INPUT command.An incremental backup copies only data file blocks that have changed since a specified previous backup. Use the BACKUP command to create incremental backups.RMAN incremental backups provide multiple benefits.Choose a backup strategy according to an acceptable MTTR (mean time to recover). You can use the Volume Shadow Copy Service (VSS) with the Oracle VSS writer to make a shadow copy or snapshot of files in a database.By incrementally updating backups, you can avoid the overhead of making full image copy backups of data files, while also minimizing time required for media recovery of your database. For example, if you run a daily backup script, then you never have more than 1 day of redo to apply for media recovery.To create incremental backups for use in an incrementally updated backup strategy, use the BACKUP ... FOR RECOVER OF COPY WITH TAG form of the BACKUP command. The command is best understood in a sample script that implements the strategy.The block change tracking feature for incremental backups improves backup performance by recording changed blocks for each data file.If block change tracking is enabled on a primary or standby database, then RMAN uses a block change tracking file to identify changed blocks for incremental backups. By reading this small bitmap file to determine which blocks changed, RMAN avoids having to scan every block in the data file that it is backing up.Oracle Database automatically manages space in the change tracking file to retain block change data that covers the eight most recent backups. After the maximum of eight bitmaps is reached, the oldest bitmap is overwritten by the bitmap that tracks the current changes.By default, the block change tracking file is created as an Oracle managed file in the destination specified by the DB_CREATE_FILE_DEST initialization parameter. You can also place the block change tracking file in any location that you choose, by specifying its name when enabling block change tracking. The size of the block change tracking file is proportional to the size of the database and the number of enabled threads of redo. You can enable block change tracking when the database is either open or mounted. When you disable block change tracking, the database removes the block change tracking file from the operating system.You can query the V$BLOCK_CHANGE_TRACKING view to determine whether change tracking is enabled, and if it is, the file name of the block change tracking file.To move the change tracking file, use the ALTER DATABASE RENAME FILE statement. You can use BACKUP... KEEP to create a backup that is both all-inclusive and exempt from the backup retention policy.You can exempt a backup from the retention policy by using the KEEP option with the BACKUP command. Typically, you make an archival backup to tape. Because your data protection backups are most likely to be on a set of tapes that remain accessible and are recycled, it is advisable to reserve a set of tapes for the archival backup. Use the BACKUP command with the KEEP option to make archival backups.One purpose of an archival backup is to create a test database. You can use the BACKUP BACKUPSET command to back up backup sets produced by other backup jobs. You can also use BACKUP RECOVERY AREA to back up recovery files created in the current and all previous fast recovery area destinations. The BACKUP BACKUPSET command creates additional copies of backup pieces in a backup set, but does not create a new backup set. For a backup retention policy based on redundancy, a backup set is counted as one instance of a backup. This statement is true even if there are multiple copies of the backup pieces that form the backup set, such as when a backup set has been backed up from disk to tape.Use the BACKUP BACKUPSET command to copy backup sets from disk to tape. Use the BACKUP command to back up image copies to tape."> Backing Up the Database</a>"</span>.

You can determine which data files need backups or which files were not backed up recently. Also, you can preview which backups RMAN must restore if a problem occurs.RMAN stores metadata of every database on which it performs operations.In a Data Guard environment, you can use the LIST, REPORT, and SHOW commands just as you can when not using Data Guard. You can run these commands with the FOR DB_UNIQUE_NAME clause to show the backups associated with a specified database. The LIST command uses the information in the RMAN repository to provide lists of backups and other objects relating to backup and recovery. The primary purpose of the LIST command is to list backup and copies. Specify the desired objects with the listObjList or recordSpec clause. If you do not specify an object, then RMAN displays copies of all database files and archived redo log files.You can specify several different conditions to narrow your LIST output.Use the LIST command to list preplugin backups and preplugin archived redo log files.Each time an OPEN RESETLOGS operation is performed on a database, this operation creates a new incarnation of the database.The RMAN REPORT command analyzes the available backups and your database. The REPORT command provides various reports of RMAN backups.Use the REPORT NEED BACKUP command to determine which database files need backup under a specific retention policy. You can use options of the REPORT NEED BACKUP command to specify different retention policies.The REPORT NEED BACKUP command can check the entire database, skip specified tablespaces, or check only specific tablespaces or data files against different retention policies.You can limit the backups tested by the REPORT NEED BACKUP command to disk-based or tape-based backups only.When a data file has been changed by an unrecoverable operation, such as a direct load insert, normal media recovery cannot be used to recover the file, because an unrecoverable operation does not generate redo. You must perform either a full or incremental backup of affected data files after such operations, to ensure that data blocks affected by the unrecoverable operation can be recovered using RMAN.You can report backup sets, backup pieces, and data file copies that are obsolete that is, not needed to meet a specified retention policy by specifying the OBSOLETE keyword. The REPORT SCHEMA command lists and displays information about the database files, tablespaces, and so on. You can view reports on the metadata related to a multitenant container database (CDB), the root only, or one or more pluggable databases (PDBs). Use the LIST command with the GUID option to list backups of pluggable databases (PDBs) that have been dropped from a multitenant container database (CDB).In some cases, V$ views supply information that is not available through use of the LIST and REPORT commands. An RMAN job is the set of commands executed within an RMAN session. Thus, one RMAN job can contain multiple commands. The ENCRYPTED column of the V$BACKUP_PIECE and V$RMAN_BACKUP_PIECE views indicates whether a backup piece is encrypted (YES) or unencrypted (NO).The LIST, REPORT, and SHOW commands provide the easiest means of accessing the data in the control file and the recovery catalog. RMAN obtains backup and recovery metadata from a target database control file and stores it in the tables of the recovery catalog. The recovery catalog views are derived from these tables. The recovery catalog views are not normalized or optimized for user queries.Most recovery catalog views contain the columns DB_KEY and DBINC_KEY. Each database registered in the recovery catalog can be uniquely identified by either the primary key, which is the DB_KEY column value, or the DBID, which is the 32-bit unique database identifier. Each incarnation of a database is uniquely identified by the DBINC_KEY column.Special considerations apply when querying the recovery catalog in a Data Guard environment. The DB_KEY value, which is the primary key for a registered database, is used only in the recovery catalog. The easiest way is to obtain the DB_KEY is to use the DBID of the target database, which is displayed whenever you connect RMAN to a database as TARGET. You can query the view RC_BACKUP_FILES for information about all backups of any database registered in the recovery catalog. Before querying RC_BACKUP_FILES, however, you must call the DBMS_RCVMAN.SETDATABASE procedure.">Reporting on RMAN Operations</a>"</span>.

In this case, the database automatically maintains and deletes backups and archived redo logs as needed. However, manual maintenance of database backups and archived redo logs is sometimes necessary.RMAN provides multiple commands to maintain RMAN backups and repository records.RMAN always stores its metadata in the control file of each target database on which it performs operations. If you register a target database in the recovery catalog, then RMAN stores the metadata for this target database in the recovery catalog. The database in a Data Guard environment that creates a backup or copy is associated with the file. For example, if RMAN is connected to target database standby1 and backs it up, then this backup is associated with standby1.For a crosscheck, RMAN can only update the status of a file from AVAILABLE to EXPIRED when connected to the database associated with the file. RMAN can delete files when connected to any database. If RMAN is not connected as TARGET to the database associated with a file, and if RMAN cannot delete a file successfully, then RMAN prompts you to connect as TARGET to the database associated with the file. You must then use DELETE ... FORCE to delete the file metadata.If a maintenance command changes RMAN metadata only, then you can connect RMAN as TARGET to any database in the Data Guard environment. A backup remains associated with a database unless you explicitly use the CHANGE ... RESET DB_UNIQUE_NAME to associate the backup with a different database.RMAN is designed to work without a recovery catalog. If you choose not to use a recovery catalog, however, then the control file of each target database is the exclusive repository for RMAN metadata.The control file contains two types of records: circular reuse records and noncircular reuse records.When a control file record containing information about a file created in the fast recovery area is about to be reused, the database attempts to delete the file from the fast recovery area when the file is eligible for deletion. Otherwise, the database expands the size of the control file section containing the record for this file.The best way to prevent the loss of RMAN metadata because of overwritten control file records is to use a recovery catalog.If you are not using a recovery catalog to store RMAN metadata, then it is doubly important that you protect each target database control file.Although the fast recovery area is largely self-managing, some situations may require database administration intervention.RMAN uses certain rules to determine when files can be deleted from the fast recovery area.You can use the V$RECOVERY_FILE_DEST and V$RECOVERY_AREA_USAGE views to determine whether you have allocated enough space for your fast recovery area.You cannot manage the flashback logs in the fast recovery area directly other than by setting the flashback retention target or using guaranteed restore points.If the RMAN retention policy requires keeping a set of backups larger than the fast recovery area disk quota, or if the retention policy is set to NONE, then the fast recovery area can fill completely with no reclaimable space.Use the ALTER SYSTEM command to change the location of the fast recovery area.The ALTER SYSTEM command can be used to disable the fast recovery area.As a rule, the fast recovery area is self-maintaining. When an instance crashes during the creation of a file in the fast recovery area, however, the database may leave the file in the fast recovery area.Several situations can cause a discrepancy between the repository and the files that it records, including tape or disk failures and user-managed copies or deletions of RMAN-related files.To ensure that data about backups in the recovery catalog or control file is synchronized with corresponding data on disk or in the media management catalog, perform a crosscheck. The CROSSCHECK command operates only on files that are currently recorded in the RMAN repository.Crosschecks update outdated RMAN repository information about backups whose repository records do not match their physical status. For example, if a user removes archived logs from disk with an operating system command, the repository still indicates that the logs are on disk, when in fact they are not.After connecting to the target database and recovery catalog (if you use one), run CROSSCHECK commands as needed to verify the status and availability of backups known to RMAN.You can use the LIST command to report your backups and then use the CROSSCHECK command to check that specific backups described in the LIST output still exist. Use the CROSSCHECK command to verify the status and availability of preplugin backups and preplugin archived redo log files known to RMAN.RMAN provides multiple methods of changing the repository status of backups and copies.Run the CHANGE...UNAVAILABLE command when a backup cannot be found or has migrated offsite.You can designate backups as exempt from the retention policy. This technique is useful for archiving backups to comply with business requirements.Use the CHANGE command with the GUID option to change the status of backups that correspond to pluggable databases (PDBs) that have been dropped from a multitenant container database (CDB).Use the CHANGE command to modify the repository status of preplugin backups and preplugin archived redo log files.You can use the CATALOG command to make RMAN aware of the existence of archived logs not recorded in the repository or copies of database files that are created through means other than RMAN. The target database control file keeps records of all archived redo logs generated by the target database and all RMAN backups. The purpose of the CATALOG command is to add metadata to the repository when it does not have a record of files for RMAN to manage.Use the CATALOG command to propagate information about user-managed copies to the RMAN repository. After the files are cataloged, you can run the LIST command or query V$BACKUP_FILES view to confirm the information is contained in the RMAN repository.You can catalog backup pieces on disk. This technique is useful if you use an operating system utility to copy backup pieces from one location to another on the same host, or from one host to another. If you use Automatic Storage Management (ASM), an Oracle Managed Files framework, or the fast recovery area, then you may want to recatalog files that are known to the disk management system but are no longer listed in the RMAN repository. This situation can occur when the intended mechanism for tracking file names fails due to media failure, software bug, or user error.Use the CATALOG command to add preplugin archived redo log files to the RMAN repository.You can remove records for files from the RMAN repository.You can use the CHANGE ... UNCATALOG command to update the RMAN repository for the absent files.You can use the RMAN DELETE command to delete archived redo logs and RMAN backups. Every RMAN backup produces a corresponding record in the RMAN repository. This record is stored in the control file. If a recovery catalog is used, then the record can also be found in the recovery catalog after the recovery catalog is resynchronized from the control file. You can delete backups and recovery catalog records for backups.The recommended maintenance strategy is to configure a fast recovery area, a backup retention policy, and an archived redo log deletion policy.Use the RMAN DELETE command to delete backups and image copies.You can use both the DELETE and BACKUP ... DELETE commands to delete specific backups and copies.You can use BACKUP ... DELETE to back up archived redo logs, data file copies, or backup sets and then delete the input files after successfully backing them up. If you run CROSSCHECK, and if RMAN cannot locate the files, then it updates their records in the RMAN repository to EXPIRED status. You can then use the DELETE EXPIRED command to remove records of expired backups and copies from the RMAN repository.The RMAN DELETE command supports an OBSOLETE option, which deletes backups that are no longer needed to satisfy specified recoverability requirements. Use the DELETE command with the GUID option to delete backups of pluggable databases (PDBs) that have been dropped from a multitenant container database (CDB).Use the DELETE command to delete preplugin backups and prelplugin archived redo log files.To remove a database from the operating system, you can use the DROP DATABASE command in RMAN. RMAN removes the server parameter file, all data files, online redo logs, and control files belonging to the target database."> Maintaining RMAN Backups and Repository&nbsp;Records</a>"</span>.

The GUI interface is available in Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control.A checker is a diagnostic operation or procedure registered with the Health Monitor to assess the health of the database or its components. A failure is a persistent data corruption that is detected by a data integrity check.Every failure has a failure status: OPEN or CLOSED. Every failure has a failure priority: CRITICAL, HIGH, or LOW. Data Recovery Advisor only assigns CRITICAL or HIGH priority to diagnosed failures.For clarity, Data Recovery Advisor groups related failures together. The ADVISE FAILURE command can present both manual and automatic repair options. Data Recovery Advisor categorizes manual actions as either mandatory or optional.When possible, Data Recovery Advisor consolidates repairs to fix multiple failures into a single repair. A consolidated repair may contain multiple steps.Whenever Data Recovery Advisor generates an automated repair option, it creates a script that explains which commands RMAN intends to use to repair the failure. Data Recovery Advisor prints the location of this script, which is a text file residing on the operating system. Data Recovery Advisor is supported only on some database configurations.Data Recovery Advisor only supports single-instance databases. Oracle Real Application Clusters (Oracle RAC) databases are not supported.There are some limitations with Data Recovery Advisor in an Oracle Data Guard environment.Data Recovery Advisor can only be used to diagnose and repair data corruptions in non-CDBs and the root of a multitenant container database (CDB). Data Recovery Advisor is not supported for pluggable databases (PDBs).The Data Recovery Advisor workflow begins when you either suspect or discover a failure. You can discover failures in many ways, including error messages, alerts, trace files, and failed data integrity checks.You can use the Data Recovery Advisor to automatically diagnose data failures, determine appropriate repair options, and execute repairs in a CDB. If you suspect or know that one or more database failures have occurred, then use LIST FAILURE to obtain information about them.The easiest way to determine problems that your database is encountering is to use the LIST FAILURE command. Besides providing more verbose output, LIST FAILURE also enables you to restrict output.The database invokes data integrity checks reactively when a user transaction is trying to access corrupted data. In some cases, latent failures can go undetected. Use the ADVISE FAILURE command to display repair options after running LIST FAILURE in an RMAN session. This command prints a summary of the failures and implicitly closes all open failures that are repaired.If one or more failures exist, then you typically use LIST FAILURE to show information about the failures and then ADVISE FAILURE in the same RMAN session to obtain a report of your repair options.You can also request repair options for specific failures. You can specify failures by status (CRITICAL, HIGH, or LOW) or by failure number. You can also use EXCLUDE FAILURE to exclude one or more failures from the report.You can use Data Recovery Advisor to repair failures automatically.If ADVISE FAILURE suggests manual repairs, then try these first. If manual repairs are not possible, or if they do not repair all failures, then you can use REPAIR FAILURE to automatically fix failures suggested in the most recent ADVISE FAILURE command in your current RMAN session.By default the script is displayed to standard output. You can use the SPOOL command to write the script to an editable file.In some situations, you may want to use the CHANGE FAILURE command to alter the status or priority of a failure."> Diagnosing and Repairing Failures with Data Recovery Advisor</a>"</span>.

To recover PDBs, you must connect to the root as a user with SYSDBA or SYSBACKUP privilege. After recovery, old backups of the PDB remain valid and can be used if a media failure occurs.The flashback features of the Oracle Database are more efficient than media recovery in most circumstances in which they are available. You can use them to investigate past states of the database.Oracle Flashback Database is the most efficient alternative to DBPITR.Logical flashback features are used to recover tables and their contents to a past time.You can perform a Flashback Database operation for a whole multitenant container database (CDB) or for a particular pluggable database (PDB). A multitenant container database (CDB) can use shared undo or local undo. The technique used by RMAN to perform flashback database operations depends on the type of undo configuration for the CDB.RMAN provides methods to manage redo corruption to data blocks in a PDB.Flashback Table uses information in the undo tablespace rather than restored backups to retrieve the table. When a Flashback Table operation occurs, new rows are deleted and old rows are reinserted. The rest of your database remains available while the flashback of the table is being performed.To perform a Flashback Table operation, the table must be eligible to be flashed back and the user performing the operation must have the required privileges.To use the Flashback Table feature on one or more tables, use the FLASHBACK TABLE SQL statement with a target time or SCN.By default, the database disables triggers on the affected table before performing a FLASHBACK TABLE operation. After the operation, the database returns the triggers to the state they were in before the operation (enabled or disabled). You can retrieve objects from the recycle bin with the FLASHBACK TABLE ... TO BEFORE DROP statement.Flashback Drop reverses the effects of a DROP TABLE operation. Flashback Drop is faster than other recovery mechanisms that can be used in this situation, such as point-in-time recovery, and does not lead to downtime or loss of recent transactions.Prerequisites must be met before you perform a Flashback Drop operation.Use the FLASHBACK TABLE ... TO BEFORE DROP statement to recover objects from the recycle bin. You can specify either the name of the table in the recycle bin or the original table name.You can create, and then drop, several objects with the same original name. All dropped objects are stored in the recycle bin.Flashback Database reverses unwanted changes by returning your database to its state at a previous point in time.Flashback Database works by undoing changes to the data files that exist at the moment that you run the command. Prerequisites must be met to perform a Flashback Database operation.A Flashback Database operation uses the FLASHBACK DATABASE command to rewind the database to a past point in time.You can perform a flashback database operation for a whole multitenant container database (CDB) using the FLASHBACK DATABASE command.You can perform a flashback database operation for a single pluggable database (PDB) in a multitenant container database (CDB) using the FLASHBACK DATABASE command.Data dictionary views contain information that is used to monitor flashback database.RMAN DBPITR restores the database from backups before the target time for recovery, then uses incremental backups and redo to roll the database forward to the target time. You can recover to an SCN, time, log sequence number, or restore point. Oracle recommends that you create restore points at important times to make point-in-time recovery more manageable if it ever becomes necessary.Certain prerequisites must be met to perform database point-in-time recovery (DBPITR).Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform DBPITR.Use the RECOVER command to perform point-in-time recovery (PITR) of container databases (CDBs) and pluggable databases (PDBs). PITR of PDBs can only be performed using RMAN.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform point-in-time recovery for a whole CDB.When you recover one or more PDBs to a specified point-in-time, the remaining PDBs in the CDB are not affected and they can be open and operational. Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform point-in-time recovery of an application PDB.Performing point-in-time recovery of sparse databases is similar to performing point-in-time recovery of normal databases. This section describes variations of the basic Flashback Database and DBPITR scenarios.Flashback Database can be used to undo an OPEN RESETLOGS operation.Flashback Database across OPEN RESETLOGS may be used to perform multiple functions in a Data Guard environment.You can use Flashback Database to rewind a database to an abandoned database incarnation.To perform DPITR to an noncurrent database incarnation, you must explicitly execute the RESET DATABASE to reset the database to the incarnation that was current at the target SCN. You must also restore a control file from the database incarnation containing the target SCN."> Performing Flashback and Database Point-in-Time Recovery</a>"</span>.

You to recover target databases to within a few subseconds of a database failure.You must plan your database restore and recovery strategy based on your recovery goal and which database files have been lost.The techniques for determining which files require restore or recovery depend upon the type of file that is lost.The database shuts down immediately when any of the multiplexed control files become inaccessible. The decision about when and how to recover depends on the state of the database and the location of its data files.An easy technique for determining which data files are missing is to run a VALIDATE DATABASE command. Although VALIDATE DATABASE is a good technique for determining whether files are inaccessible, you may want to use SQL queries to obtain more detailed information. It is recommended that you record the DBID of your database.Previewing backups helps you to ensure that all backups required for a restore and recovery operation are available.An offsite backup is stored in a remote location, such as a secure storage facility, and cannot be restored unless the media manager retrieves the media.Validating backups determines if the backups are usable.RMAN restores archived redo log files from backup automatically as needed to perform recovery.RMAN enables you to override the default location for restored archived redo log files.To manage disk space that is used to contain the restored logs, you can specify restore destinations for archived logs multiple times in one RUN block, to distribute restored logs among several destinations.For backups encrypted using certain techniques, you must provide the password that will be used to decrypt these backups.During complete recovery RMAN restores one or more data files and then applies all the redo generated after the restored backup.You use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to restore and recover the database. If you cannot restore data files to their default locations, then you must update the control file to reflect the new locations of the data files.This scenario assumes that database trgt has lost most or all of its data files. It also assumes that the database uses a fast recovery area.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands with the TABLESPACE option to perform complete recovery of a tablespaceYou can recover a database by switching to image copies of inaccessible data files. This technique takes less time than traditional restore and recovery because no backups need to be restored.When one or more data files are damaged, you can perform recovery by switching to existing image copies of the damaged data files.You can perform complete database recovery by switching to image copies of the damaged data files instead of restoring these data files.RMAN and Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) provide full support for backup and recovery in a multitenant environment. When you recover a whole CDB, you recover the root and all PDBs in a single operation.You might consider recovering only the root if a data corruption or user error occurs that affects only the root.You can perform complete recovery of one or more PDBs without affecting operations of other open PDBs.Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) provides an interface to recover PDBs.Use the RECOVER command to perform complete recovery using preplugin backups.Preplugin backups are used to restore and recover a PDB to its state at a time in the past that was before the PDB was plugged in to the current CDB. RMAN performs complete recovery of a PDB using preplugin backups. These preplugin backups were created on a source non-CDB or a source CDB before the PDB was migrated to the current target CDB. This example performs complete recovery of a PDB my_pdb in the destination CDB prod_cdb using preplugin backups.Because tablespaces in different PDBs can have the same name, to eliminate ambiguity, you must connect directly to a PDB to recover one or more of its tablespaces. In contrast, because data file numbers and paths are unique across the CDB, you can connect either to the root or to a PDB when recovering PDB data files.Oracle Enterprise Manager Cloud Control (Cloud Control) provides an interface to recover tablespaces within a PDB.Recovering a CDB by switching to a copy is faster than traditional restore and recovery.RMAN enables you to use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform complete recovery of the application containers without impacting the other containers in the CDB.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform complete recovery of the application root.You can perform complete recovery of an application container, which includes the application root and all its application PDBs without impacting the other PDBs within the CDB.Use the RESTORE and RECOVER commands to perform complete recovery of one or more application PDBs.You can recover sparse databases to the most recent point in time using the RESTORE and RECOVER commands.Performing recovery of a database containing sparse data files is very similar to performing recovery of a whole database.Performing recovery of a sparse CDB is very similar to performing the complete recovery of a sparse database. You can recover a sparse PDB while you are connected at the root level or at the CDB level."> Performing Complete Database Recovery</a>"</span>.

Oracle Flashback Database returns your entire database or an entire PDB to a previous state without requiring you to restore files from backup.The SQL*Plus FLASHBACK DATABASE command performs the same function as the RMAN FLASHBACK DATABASE command: it returns the database to a prior state.Use the SQL*Plus FLASHBACK DATABASE command to return a whole multitenant container database (CDB) to a prior state. The SQL*Plus FLASHBACK DATABASE command performs the same function as the RMAN FLASHBACK DATABASE command.Use the SQL*Plus FLASHBACK DATABASE command to return a specific pluggable database (PDB) to a prior state. The remaining PDBs in the multitenant container database (CDB) are not impacted by the flashback operation on a single PDB.No additional setup is required to perform recovery when the archived redo log files are present in the default location.To perform media recovery when archived redo log files are stored in a nondefault location, you must specify the location of archived redo log files.Typically, you perform complete recovery of the database when a media failure has made one or more data files inaccessible. During complete database recovery, you use all available redo to recover the database to the current SCN. When performing complete recovery while the database is not open, you can recover either all damaged data files in one operation or perform individual recovery of each damaged data file in separate operations.You can perform complete recovery of non-SYSTEM data files in a database while the database is open.Oracle Database performs crash and instance recovery for the entire multitenant container database (CDB). You cannot recover individual pluggable databases (PDBs).Incomplete recovery is also known as database point-in-time recovery.In cancel-based recovery, recovery proceeds by prompting you with the suggested file names of archived redo log files. Recovery stops when you specify CANCEL instead of a file name or when all redo has been applied to the data files.You can specify an SCN or time for the end point of incomplete recovery."> Performing User-Managed Database Flashback and Recovery</a>.
