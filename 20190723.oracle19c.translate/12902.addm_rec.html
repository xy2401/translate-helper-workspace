            <p>This screenshot shows the Recommendations section of the Performance Finding Details page.</p>
            <p>Underneath the section title is the following left-justified button: Schedule SQL Tuning Advisor.</p>
            <p>The following left-justified links are shown in a row: Select All, Select None, Show All Details, Hide All Details. </p>
            <p>Underneath the row of links is a table. The table contains the following columns: Select, Details, Category, and Benefit (%). Values in the Details column are displayed as a collapsible navigation tree. Values in the Benefit column are displayed as a horizontal bar chart with an associated number.</p>
            <p>3 rows are shown in the table. The values of row 1 are: null, Hide, SQL Tuning, and 26.7. Under row 1 are 7 label-value pairs that show the actions to perform for the recommendation in row 1 and rationales for the actions. The first two labels are Action and the other five labels are Rationale. The value of the first action label is: Run SQL Tuning Advisor on the SELECT statement with the SQL_ID "ddthrb7j9a63f". Additionally, investigate this statement for possible performance improvements. You can supplement the information given here with an ASH report for this SQL_ID. Under that text are two buttons: Run Advisor Now, Filters. Below the buttons are two label-value pairs. The value for the SQL Text label is: SELECT E.LAST_NAME, D.DEPARTMENT_NAME FROM HR_EMPLOYEES E, HR.DEPARTMENTS D WHER.... The value for the SQL_ID label is: ddthrb7j9a63f.</p>
            <p>The value of the second Action label is: Use bigger fetch arrays while fetching results from the SELECT statement with SQL_ID "ddthrb7j9a63f". After that sentence are two label-value pairs. The value for the SQL Text label is: SELECT E.LAST_NAME, D.DEPARTMENT_NAME FROM HR_EMPLOYEES E, HR.DEPARTMENTS D WHER.... The value for the SQL_ID label is: ddthrb7j9a63f.</p>
            <p>The value of the first rationale is: The SQL spent 70% of its database time on CPU, I/O and Cluster waits. This part of the database time may be improved by the SQL Tuning Advisor. Look at data given below and an ASH report for further performance improvements. The value of the second rationale is: Database time for this SQL was divided as follows: 100% for SQL execution, 0% for parsing, 0% for PL/SQL execution and 0% for Java execution. The value of the third rationale is: SQL statement with SQL_ID "ddthrb7j9a63f" was executed 130081 times and had an average elapsed time of 0.00098 seconds. The value of the fourth rationale is: Waiting for event "buffer busy waits" in wait class "Concurrency" accounted for 18% of the database time spent in processing the SQL statement with SQL_ID "ddthrb7j9a63f". The value of the fifth rationale is: Top level calls to execute the PL/SQL statement with SQL_ID "3575p6hzg9gat" are responsible for 100% of the database time spent on the SELECT statement with SQL_ID "ddthrb7j9a63f". After the last rationale are two label-value pairs. The value for the SQL Text label is: DECLARE n number; v_employees_last name .... The value for the SQL_ID label is: 3575p6hzg9gat.</p>
            <p>The values of row 2 are: null (a checked box is shown), Show, SQL Tuning, and 10.9. The values of row 3 are: null, Show, SQL Tuning, and 10.9.</p>
