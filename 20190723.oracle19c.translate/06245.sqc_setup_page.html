            <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
               <li>
                  <p>Optimal (Hybrid): This is the recommended mode. It finds SQLs with plan changes first by generating plan, then test-executes SQL statements with plan changes.</p>

               <li>
                  <p>Test Execute: Test-execute every SQL statement and collect its execution plans and executions statistics.</p>

               </li>
            </ul>
            <p>The Workload Impact Threshold(%), SQL Impact Threshold(%) section includes the text "These settings control the threshold where SQL is reported as having regressed or improved. The Workload Impact Threshold is the percent impact of the chosen metric on the entire workload. The SQL Impact Threshold is the percent impact of the chosen metric on the individual SQL statement. Only statements that exceed both percentages will be reported as regressed or improved."</p>
            <p>The Disable Multiple Executions section includes the text "By default, SPA executes short running SQL multiple times to eliminate buffer warm up effects. This option enables those multiple executions."</p>
