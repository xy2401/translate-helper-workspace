               <div>
                  <p>In many applications, capabilities or objects are modeled as nodes and links in a network. The network model contains logical information such as connectivity relationships among nodes and links, directions of links, and costs of nodes and links.</p>
                  <p>With logical network information, you can analyze a network and answer questions, many of them related to path computing and tracing. For example, for a biochemical pathway, you can find all possible reaction paths between two chemical compounds; or for a road network, you can find the following information: </p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>What is the shortest (distance) or fastest (travel time) path between two cities?</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>What is the closest hotel to a specific airport, and how can I get there? </p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>In addition to logical network information, spatial information such as node locations and link geometries can be associated with the network. This information can help you to model the logical information (such as the cost of a route, because its physical length can be directly computed from its spatial representation).</p>
                  <p>The Spatial and Graph Network Data Model Graph feature can be used for large, complex networks. For example, <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-3D943949-5DA2-4225-9EA5-9496399646F5__CIHJIIID">Figure 5-1</a> shows San Francisco and links, which have been defined using the Network Data Model Graph feature, displayed in a demo web-based application for network analysis. (You can install this demo using the NDM tutorial described in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-525D85C3-2E61-429F-ACF2-BB3BAE57C039" title="Network Data Model Graph learning resources are available.">Network Data Model Graph Tutorial and Other Resources</a>.)

                  <p>The generic data model and network analysis capability can model and analyze many kinds of network applications in addition to traditional geographical information systems (GIS). For example, in biochemistry, applications may need to model reaction pathway networks for living organisms; and in the pharmaceutical industry, applications that model the drug discovery process may need to model protein-protein interaction.</p>
                  <p>The network modeling capabilities of Spatial and Graph include schema objects and an application programming interface (API). The schema objects include metadata and network tables. The API includes a server-side PL/SQL API (the SDO_NET package) for creating and managing networks in the database, and a middle-tier (or client-side) Java API for network editing and analysis.</p>

               <div>
                  <p>This topic summarizes the main steps for working with the Network Data Model Graph feature in Oracle Spatial and Graph. It refers to important concepts, structures, and operations that are described in detail in other topics.</p>
                  <p>There are two basic approaches to creating a network:</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>Let Spatial and Graph perform most operations, using procedures with names in the form CREATE_<span class="italic">&lt;network-type&gt;</span>_NETWORK.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Perform the operations yourself: create the necessary network tables and update the network metadata.</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>With each approach, you must insert the network data into the network tables. You can then use the Network Data Model Graph PL/SQL and Java application programming interfaces (APIs) to update the network and perform other operations. (The PL/SQL and Java APIs are described in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-B16D53F5-7E65-487D-98E9-8A606F457C82" title="The Oracle Spatial and Graph Network Data Model Graph feature includes two client application programming interfaces (APIs): a PL/SQL interface provided by the SDO_NET package and a Java interface.">Network Data Model Graph Application Programming Interface</a>.)

               <div>
                  <p>A network is a type of mathematical graph that captures relationships between objects using connectivity.</p>
                  <p>The connectivity may or may not be based on spatial proximity. For example, if two towns are on opposite sides of a lake, the shortest path based on spatial proximity (a straight line across the middle of the lake) is not relevant if you want to drive from one town to the other. Instead, to find the shortest driving distance, you need connectivity information about roads and intersections and about the "cost" of individual links.</p>
                  <p>A network consists of a set of nodes and links. Each link (sometimes also called an edge or a segment) specifies two nodes.</p>

                        <p>A <span class="bold">node</span>, also called a vertex, is a point where links can join each other.

(Repeating nodes and links within a path are permitted, but are rare in most network applications.)

                     <p>In a typical road network, the intersections of roads are nodes and the road segments between two intersections are links. The spatial representation of a road is not inherently related to the nodes and links in the network. For example, a shape point in the spatial representation of a road (reflecting a sharp turn in the road) is not a node in the network if that shape point is not associated with an intersection; and a single spatial object may make up several links in a network (such as a straight segment intersected by three crossing roads). An important operation with a road network is to find the path from a start point to an end point, minimizing either the travel time or distance. There may be additional constraints on the path computation, such as having the path go through a particular landmark or avoid a particular intersection.</p>

                     <p>Multimodal networks are networks that consist of multiple modes, such as a network consisting of driving and walking routes. They are usually modeled as individual networks (of the specific mode) and are treated as an aggregate network so that routes of single mode as well as multiple modes can be represented and computed. In general, multimodal networks are "connected" by schedules of different modes, and in such cases they are also <span class="italic">temporal</span> networks. An example is to compute an itinerary with walking to nearest bus stop, taking the fastest bus route, getting off at the stop that is closest to the destination, then walking to your destination. You could also add modes like driving or flight to be taken into consideration.
                     </p>
                     <p><span class="bold">Temporal</span> modeling and analysis adds a temporal (time) dimension to network modeling and analysis. The time factor provides cost and/or constraints on top of static (non-temporal) networks. An example is to consider traffic patterns (time-dependent travel time costs) instead of static travel-time costs.
                     </p>
                     <p>Many metropolitan transportation networks consist of multiple modes such as buses, subways, and commuter rail lines, where transfers across modes are possible (for example, from a bus to the subway). Each transportation mode has a component network within the larger transportation network. The component networks can be modeled using nodes and links, and the transfers across modes can be modeled as links that connect the stops where transfers are possible.</p>
                     <p>An important feature of such multimodal transportation networks is their schedule-based operation. When performing common network operations such as computing the fastest route from a start point to an end point, the schedule information and possible transfers across modes must be considered. The schedule information at stops can be represented as user-defined data at the nodes representing these stops. Examples of operations that use schedule information in a multimodal network are (A) finding the fastest route (minimum travel time) from a start point to an end point for a specified start time, and (B) finding the latest departure time at a start point to reach an end point by a specified arrival time.</p>

                  <p>Some network applications require representations at different levels of abstraction. For example, two major processes might be represented as nodes with a link between them at the highest level of abstraction, and each major process might have several subordinate processes that are represented as nodes and links at the next level down.</p>
                  <p>A <span class="bold">network hierarchy</span> enables you to represent a network with multiple levels of abstraction by assigning a hierarchy level to each node. (Links are not assigned a hierarchy level, and links can be between nodes in the same hierarchy level or in different levels.) The lowest (most detailed) level in the hierarchy is level 1, and successive higher levels are numbered 2, 3, and so on.

                  <p>Given certain grouping of nodes in a network, a parent network can be defined. The group IDs in the child network are used as node IDs in the parent network.

                  <p>A network can have multiple ways of grouping its nodes based on different criteria; therefore, it can have multiple parent networks. In addition, nodes in a parent network can be further grouped to form a higher-level parent network. For example, in a social network, members can be grouped by city, profession, income, or other criteria. Members grouped by city, for example, can be further grouped into higher-level county, state, or country networks.</p>
                  <p>The parent-child network relationship is defined through the CHILD_NETWORK and HIERARCHY_TABLE_NAME columns in the network metadata.</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>For user data defined through the <span class="italic">xxx</span>_SDO_NETWORK_USER_DATA views, the default user data I/O implementation (<code class="codeph">LODUserDataIOSDO</code>) is used to access the user data during network analysis. However, some user data is not included in the node or link table, and thus cannot be registered through xxx_SDO_NETWORK_USER_DATA views. 
                  </p>
                  <p>For such user data, users must provide their own custom implementation of the user data I/O interface. A typical way of implementing a custom data I/O interface is to generate BLOBs corresponding to node and link user data, one BLOB for each partition, and then retrieve user data information from the BLOBs during network analysis.</p>
                  <p>Network Data Model Graph also allows you to associate multiple categories of user-defined data (categorized user data) with a single network. For example, in a multimodal network, if you need to associate driving-related attributes (such as speed limit) with a link in addition to the link's multimodal attributes, user-defined data can be organized in two categories, one for driving-related attributes and the other for multimodal attributes.</p>
                  <p>See these examples of user-defined data:</p>

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>You can model objects of interest on the network as features.</p>
                  <p>A feature consists of one or many feature elements. A feature element can be a point, a link, or a partial link along the network. You can define feature layers on top of a network. For example, restaurants and hotels can each be defined as a feature layer on a road network, and switches can be defined as a feature layer on an electrical network.</p>
                  <p>The following are the typical steps for using feature modeling.</p>
                  <ol>
                     <li>
                        <p>Create a feature layer.</p>
                        <p>For example, the points of interest (POIs) on a road network can be modeled as features. Each type of POI (hotels, restaurants, hospitals, schools, and so on) corresponds to one feature layer. The following example adds a feature layer for hotels:</p><pre class="oac_no_warn" dir="ltr">sdo_net.add_feature_layer(
   'US_ROAD_NETWORK', --network name
   'HOTEL',           --feature layer name
   2,                 --feature layer type: point on link
   'HOTEL_TAB',       --feature table or view name
   'HOTEL_NET_REL',   --relation table or view name
   null);             --hierarchy table or view name
</pre></li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Register feature user data, if any application-specific feature attributes are potentially useful in feature analysis.</p>
                        <p>Feature user data is registered by adding an entry in the XXX_SDO_NETWORK_USER_DATA view, just like registering the user data for network nodes or links, except that the TABLE_TYPE column is set to the name of the feature table. The following example adds hotel name as user data for hotel features:</p><pre class="oac_no_warn" dir="ltr">INSERT INTO USER_SDO_NETWORK_USER_DATA(
   network, table_type, data_name, data_type, category_id)
VALUES(
   'US_ROAD_NETWORK',  --network name
   'HOTEL_TAB', 	       --feature table or view name
   'NAME',             --user data name, i.e., name of the user data column
   'VARCHAR2',         --user data type
   3);                 --user data category
</pre></li>
                     <li>
                        <p>Add, update, or delete features on the feature layer.</p>
                        <p>If the content of feature tables, feature element relationship table, and feature hierarchy table (all described in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-35322E5A-1564-4DA5-BCF5-04D569373F99">Feature Layer Tables</a>) -- or any combination of these tables -- is managed by the data provider, then you can skip this step. Otherwise, you can call procedures in the SDO_NET package, such as ADD_FEATURE, UPDATE_FEATURE, DELETE_FEATURES, to add, update or delete features in a feature layer. (The SDO_NET subprograms are described in <a href="SDO_NET-reference.html#GUID-1AE39EF8-CE36-4EC4-99D8-8678818E6E5E" title="The MDSYS.SDO_NET package contains subprograms (functions and procedures) for managing networks."> SDO_NET Package Subprograms</a>.)

               </h3>
               <div>
                  <p>Network feature editing (NFE) lets you create and manage an NFE model. An <span class="bold">NFE model</span> extends the feature modeling capabilities by enabling you to visualize and manipulate features using Java Swing components and a PL/SQL API. 
                  </p>
                  <p>NFE lets you define features on the top of an existing network. For example, restaurants and hotels can be defined as features on the top of a road network. You can also define models that consist just of features (network elements are hidden from you), and where the connectivity can be restricted by rules. Such connectivity restrictions are typically used in utility networks, such as electrical, water, or gas networks, to model the network devices and restrict the connectivity. One example of using connectivity restrictions is to avoid connections between high tension and low tension devices in an electrical network </p>
                  <p>NFE includes concepts such as feature classes and rules, which can be built into a model. Metadata tables and views are automatically created and maintained when you create and work with an NFE model.</p>
                  <p>The minimum privileges required for using NFE features are <code class="codeph">CREATE TABLE</code>,<code class="codeph">CREATE VIEW</code>, <code class="codeph">CREATE SEQUENCE</code>, and <code class="codeph">CREATE SESSION</code>. These are in addition to any other privileges that the user might need to perform operations not specifically related to NFE.

                     <p><span class="bold">Rules</span> in NFE models are constraints related to feature connections. Rules are available only for models created from scratch, that is, not for models created over an existing network. Rules can be customized, and can support any kind of connection constraint.
                     </p>
                     <p>Rules can generally be classified into cardinality rules and connectivity rules:</p>
                     <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                        <li>
                           <p>Cardinality rules are used over point features that have specific characteristics (that is, belong to the same feature class), to specify the maximum and minimum number of incoming and outgoing connections that the point feature can accept.</p>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                           <p>Connectivity rules are used to indicate whether two features can be connected if they have some specific characteristics (feature layer, feature class, and attributes) and a specific interaction. A connectivity rule will allow the connection with a point feature as long as the point feature has available space to support the corresponding incoming and outgoing connections needed, as dictated by its related cardinality rule.</p>
                           <p>Connectivity rules are the only way to connect features in NFE, and they are always positive; that is, they allow connections, but cannot deny them. The absence of connectivity rules between elements indicates that elements cannot be connected.</p>
                        </li>

                        <p>A line-point connectivity rule states that whenever a line feature and a point feature interact in certain ways, they can be connected.</p>
                        <p>A line-point connectivity rule, along with its cardinality rule, can be expressed as follows: “Any Line Feature from Feature Layer L1 with Feature Class C1 matching the condition P1 can be connected to a Point Feature from Feature Layer L2 with Feature Class C2 matching the condition P2. The cardinality of Point Feature indicates that maximum of X incoming connections and a maximum of Y outgoing connections are allowed.”</p>

                        <p>A line-line connectivity rule states that when two line features interact in some specific way, they can be connected through one specific point feature. The rule can also specify to automatically create the connecting point, if it does not already exist, when the interaction between the feature lines occurs.  Another way of looking at a line-line rule is as two line-point rules having in common the same point feature restrictions, so in that sense a line-line rule refers to two line-point rules with the same point feature condition.</p>

                        <p>Rules can be customized by using rule decision handlers, which can be applied to both line-point and line-line rules. <span class="bold">Decision handlers</span> are a mechanism that allows a user to determine which elements in an interaction must be connected and how.
                        </p>
                        <p>A rule implementation always uses a decision handler to manage the connections among the features. NFE provides a default implementation to connect features for line-point and line-line rules. When executing a rule, the default decision handler implementation will try to connect as many elements matching the rule as possible, but there could be scenarios where you want more control over the connections than the rule provides by default, in which case you must modify the default decision handler implementation..</p>
                        <p>Using a water network example, assume that two valves can interact with pipes at a spatial point. Each valve has four outlets. Either (A) all four pipe ends can be connected to the four outlets of a single valve, or (B) two pipe ends can connect to two opposite outlets of one valve, and the two other pipe ends can connect to two opposite outlets of the other valve. The default decision handler implementation will try the first approach (all four pipe ends connecting to a single valve); but if you wanted to distribute the four pipes among the two available valves, you could implement a custom decision handler tio use the second approach (two pipe ends connecting to the first valve, the two other pipe ends connecting to the second valve).</p>

                        <p>When features are connected because of the application of certain rule, the group of connected features is called a <span class="bold">rule instance</span>, that is, an instance of the rule that allowed the connection.

                        <p>A rule definition can be removed or modified only if no dependent rule instances exist (that is, no connections that depend on any existing rule instances) </p>
                        <p>If a feature element involved in a rule instance is deleted, the rule instance may or may not be automatically deleted. If the feature element deletion causes the number of elements to drop below the minimum number for the rule instance (which depends on the type of rule), then the rule instance is deleted. However, if the feature element deletion does not cause the number of elements to drop below the minimum number for the rule instance, then the feature element is deleted from the rule instance, but the .the rule instance itself is not deleted (but it is modified).</p>

               <div>
                  <p><span class="bold">Network constraints</span> are restrictions defined on network analysis computations. 
                  </p>
                  <p>For example, a network constraint might list a series of prohibited turns in a roads network due to one-way streets and "No Left Turn" signs, with each prohibited turn represented as a pair of links (a start link and an end link onto which a turn cannot be made from the start link). As another example, a network constraint might require that driving routes must not include toll roads or must not include expressways.</p>
                  <p>To create a network constraint, you must create a Java class that implements the constraint, and you must register the constraint by using the <a href="SDO_NET-reference.html#GUID-47B852BA-EAFC-453F-85F1-20A7DCF541D9">SDO_NET.REGISTER_CONSTRAINT</a> procedure. To apply a network constraint to a network analysis operation, you must specify that constraint.
                  </p>
                  <p>Examples of Java classes to implement network constraints are provided in the Network Data Model Graph demo files, which are described in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-525D85C3-2E61-429F-ACF2-BB3BAE57C039" title="Network Data Model Graph learning resources are available.">Network Data Model Graph Tutorial and Other Resources</a>. For example, the <code class="codeph">ProhibitedTurns.java</code> file creates a network constraint that defines a series of prohibited turns, and it then returns the shortest path between two nodes, first without applying the constraint and then applying the constraint.

                     <p>You can partition a network using the <a href="SDO_NET-reference.html#GUID-EE17EF34-B664-4EEA-8F77-2C4A5A379EA0">SDO_NET.SPATIAL_PARTITION</a> procedure, specifying the maximum number of nodes in each partition. The partition result is stored in a partition table, which is automatically generated, and partition metadata information is inserted into the network metadata. (As an alternative to using the procedure, you can partition a network by creating and populating a partition table.) You can use other SDO_NET subprograms to query the partitioning metadata.
                     </p>
                     <p>A good partition strategy is to minimize the number of links between partitions, which reduces the number of partitions that need to be loaded and the probable number of times that the same partitions need to be reloaded. Moreover, partitions that are too small require excessive loading and unloading of partitions during analysis.</p>
                     <p>The recommended maximum number of nodes per partition, assuming 1 GB of memory, is between 5,000 and 10,000. You can tune the number and see what is best for your applications, considering the available memory, type of analysis, and network size. You should also consider configuring the partition caching size.</p>

                     <p>To enhance the performance of network loading, you can optionally store partitions as BLOBs in a network partition BLOB table. This information needs to be stored in the network metadata view in order to take advantage of faster partition loading time. Note that if a network or partition information is updated, the partition BLOBs need to be regenerated as well.</p>
                     <p>A <span class="bold">partition BLOB</span> is a binary stream of data containing the network partition information, such as number of nodes, number of links, properties of each node, properties of each link, and so on.

                  <div>
                     <p>Although the load on demand approach reduces the effect of memory limitations in analyzing large networks, analysis operations still can sometimes be very slow. For example, shortest path analysis of two nodes diagonally across the entire network is likely to require traversing almost every link in the network, and this will take a significant amount of time for a network with more than, for example, two million nodes.</p>
                     <p>To further reduce network analysis time, you can perform analysis on different link levels. <span class="bold">Link level</span> is a positive integer assigned to a link indicating the level of preference of this link. The higher the link level, the higher the preference. For example, a road network may consist of two link levels, level 1 for local roads and level 2 for highways. During network analysis, highways are preferred to local roads, and the minimum link level is 1. (If no link level is assigned to a link, the default link level of 1 is used for the link.)
                     </p>
                     <p>Link levels have an implicit inheritance property, which means that a network at higher link levels must be a subnetwork of a network at a lower link level. That is, link level 2 is a subnetwork of link level 1, link level 3 is a subnetwork of link level 2, and so on.</p>
                     <p>You can specify a link level when you load a network or a partition, which causes links at that level and higher levels to be loaded. Using the road network example, with link level 1 for local roads and link level 2 for highways, specifying link level 1 on a load operation loads links at link levels 1 and 2 (that is, local roads and highways), but specifying link level 2 on a load operation loads only the highways links. If you wanted to perform analysis using only highways links, you could optimize the performance by specifying link level 2 for the load operation.</p>

Thus, to assign a driving time, scenic appeal rating, and a danger rating to each link, you could use the COST column for driving time, add columns for SCENIC_APPEAL and DANGER to the link table, and populate all three columns with values to be interpreted by applications.</p>

                        <p>Each partitioned network can have a partition BLOB table, which stores binary large object (BLOB) representations for each combination of link level and partition ID in the network. Having BLOB representations of partitions enables better performance for network load on demand analysis operations. To create the partition BLOB table, use the <a href="SDO_NET-reference.html#GUID-C90ADE79-BBA7-4709-9178-BFF038A799BA">SDO_NET.GENERATE_PARTITION_BLOBS</a> procedure, where you specify the partition BLOB table name as one of the parameters. For information about partitioned networks, see <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-718EB9E1-3ED8-4CA0-B098-1ED8EC6D07B6" title="Load on demand means that during network analysis, a network partition is not loaded into memory until the analysis has reached this partition while exploring the network.">Network Analysis Using Load on Demand</a>.

                     <p>To use user-defined data, you must set the USER_DEFINED_DATA column value to <code class="codeph">Y</code> in the appropriate xxx_SDO_NETWORK_METADATA views (described in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-1A68FE59-47F0-4583-9D0B-F81D4EC136DF">xxx_SDO_NETWORK_METADATA Views</a>).
                     </p>
                     <p>For an example of using user-defined data, see <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-21E1DBEB-308E-436F-9D7B-588E1003285E">User-Defined Data Examples (PL/SQL and Java)</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>For user data defined through the xxx_SDO_NETWORK_USER_DATA views, the default user data I/O implementation (<code class="codeph">LODUserDataIOSDO</code>) is used to access the user data during network analysis. However, some user data is not included in the node or link table, and thus cannot be registered through xxx_SDO_NETWORK_USER_DATA views. For such user data, you must provide your own implementation of the user data I/O interface. A typical way of implementing a custom user data I/O interface is to generate BLOBs corresponding to node and link user data , one BLOB for each partition, and then retrieve user data information from the BLOBs during network analysis.
                     </p>
                     <p>You can also associate multiple categories of user-defined data (categorized user data) with a single network. For example, in a multimodal network (described in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-0C2DA8C4-B883-4C18-90B4-D45297DA64EE">Multimodal Network and Temporal Examples</a>), if you must associate driving-related attributes (such as speed limit) with a link in addition to the link's multimodal attributes, you can organize user-defined data in two categories: one for driving-related attributes and the other for multimodal attributes.

                     <p>To use user-defined data, you must set the USER_DEFINED_DATA column value to <code class="codeph">Y</code> in the appropriate xxx_SDO_NETWORK_METADATA views (described in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-1A68FE59-47F0-4583-9D0B-F81D4EC136DF">xxx_SDO_NETWORK_METADATA Views</a>).
                     </p>
                     <p>For an example of using user-defined data, see <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-21E1DBEB-308E-436F-9D7B-588E1003285E">User-Defined Data Examples (PL/SQL and Java)</a>.
                     </p>
                     <p>For user data defined through the xxx_SDO_NETWORK_USER_DATA views, the default user data I/O implementation (<code class="codeph">LODUserDataIOSDO</code>) is used to access the user data during network analysis. However, some user data is not included in the node or link table, and thus cannot be registered through xxx_SDO_NETWORK_USER_DATA views. For such user data, you must provide your own implementation of the user data I/O interface. A typical way of implementing a custom user data I/O interface is to generate BLOBs corresponding to node and link user data , one BLOB for each partition, and then retrieve user data information from the BLOBs during network analysis.
                     </p>
                     <p>You can also associate multiple categories of user-defined data (categorized user data) with a single network. For example, in a multimodal network (described in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-0C2DA8C4-B883-4C18-90B4-D45297DA64EE">Multimodal Network and Temporal Examples</a>), if you must associate driving-related attributes (such as speed limit) with a link in addition to the link's multimodal attributes, you can organize user-defined data in two categories: one for driving-related attributes and the other for multimodal attributes.

The feature user data catalog table keeps a register of the catalogs that can be used for that purpose.The feature user data catalog values table contains the list of values held by catalogs defined in feature user data catalog table.The point cardinality rules table contains the configuration of the maximum and minimum inbound and outbound connections that a specific point feature must support in an NFE model. The rule decision handlers table contains information about the names of the Java class and/or PL/SQL procedures to be executed as decision handlers when a connectivity rule (line-line or line-point) is executed. The rule instance table contains information about rule instances generated by the application of either line-line or line-point connectivity rules in an NFE model.">Network Feature Editing (NFE) Model Tables</a> are registered.

               <div>
                  <p>The Oracle Spatial and Graph Network Data Model Graph feature includes two client application programming interfaces (APIs): a PL/SQL interface provided by the SDO_NET package and a Java interface.</p>
                  <p>Both interfaces let you create and update network data, and the Java interface lets you perform network analysis. It is recommended that you use only PL/SQL or SQL to populate network tables and to create indexes, and that you mainly use Java for application development.</p>
                  <p><a id="d26050e9381" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d26050e9387" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d26050e9393" class="indexterm-anchor"></a><a id="d26050e9399" class="indexterm-anchor"></a>The following performance considerations apply to the PL/SQL and Java APIs:
                  </p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>If you plan to analyze or edit only nonspatial aspects of a spatial network, you can get better performance by setting the NETWORK_CATEGORY column value to <code class="codeph">LOGICAL</code> in the USER_SDO_NETWORK_METADATA view (described in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-1A68FE59-47F0-4583-9D0B-F81D4EC136DF">xxx_SDO_NETWORK_METADATA Views</a>) before performing the analysis or editing, and then changing the value back to <code class="codeph">SPATIAL</code> afterward.
                        </p>
                        <p>For example, you could use this technique when finding the shortest path between two nodes, because the shortest-path computation considers cost values. However, you could not use this technique when setting the spatial geometry object or the end measure value for a link.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>If you do not plan to modify any network objects (that is, if you plan to perform only network analysis operations or to retrieve network information), you can get better performance by creating the network memory object as read-only (that is, by specifying that updates are not allowed).</p>

                        <p>The XML API can take user-specified constraints, cost calculators, or even network analysis algorithm settings, by letting you specify the Java class that implements the LOD interfaces. For any implementation that requires input parameters, such as truck weight or height in a trucking constraint implementation, the Java class must implement the <code class="codeph">oracle.spatial.network.lod.XMLConfigurable</code> interface, that is, it must implement the following two methods:
                        </p>

                        <p>The <code class="codeph">init</code> method lets you pass in the input parameter as an XML element, which must follow the schema returned from the <code class="codeph">getXMLSchema</code> method.

                  <p>If database users other than the network owner need to read a network into memory, you need to do one of the following options.</p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>For each non-owner user, qualify the network tables with the schema of the network owner in the USER_SDO_NETWORK_METADATA view, as explained in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-6EB3A331-78FB-40ED-AC06-863C9445B4AD">Cross-Schema Access by Specifying Owner in Network Metadata</a>.
                        </p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>For each non-owner user, create views on the Network Data Model Graph tables and update the USER_SDO_NETWORK_METADATA view, as explained in <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-840FB4A3-6F0A-4FEA-BF4F-E0E351E2B854">Cross-Schema Access by Using Views</a>.

                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>The second approach requires the extra step of creating views, but the views provide you with flexibility in controlling the parts of the network that are accessible. Each view can provide access to all of the network, or it can use a WHERE clause to provide access to just one or more parts (for example, <code class="codeph">WHERE STATE_CODE='NY'</code> to restrict the view users to rows for New York) .
                  </p>
                  <p>Consider the following example scenario: </p>
                  <ul style="list-style-type: disc;">
                     <li>
                        <p>User1 creates (and thus owns) Network1.</p>
                     </li>
                     <li>
                        <p>User2 attempts to call the SDO_NET_MEM.NETWORK_MANAGER.READ_NETWORK procedure to read Network1, but receives an error. The error occurs even though User2 has the appropriate privileges on the Network Data Model Graph tables for Network1.</p>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  <p>To work around this problem, you must use the approach in either <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-6EB3A331-78FB-40ED-AC06-863C9445B4AD">Cross-Schema Access by Specifying Owner in Network Metadata</a> or <a href="network-data-model-graph-overview.html#GUID-840FB4A3-6F0A-4FEA-BF4F-E0E351E2B854">Cross-Schema Access by Using Views</a>.

                        <li>
                           <p>Ensure that the user has SELECT or READ privilege access to the necessary Network Data Model Graph tables. If the user does not have this access, connect as the network owner and grant it. For example, connect as User1 and execute the following statements:</p><pre class="oac_no_warn" dir="ltr">GRANT select ON network1_node$ TO user2;
GRANT select ON network1_link$ TO user2;
GRANT select ON network1_path$ TO user2;
GRANT select ON network1_plink$ TO user2;
