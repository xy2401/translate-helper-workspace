<h1 class="id_title">J2EE architecture</h1>



<div class="id_conbody"><p class="id_shortdesc">The Javaâ„¢ 2 Platform, Enterprise Edition (J2EE)
provides a standard for developing multitier, enterprise applications.</p>

<p class="anchor_topictop" />

<p>The economy and technology of today have intensified the need for faster,
more efficient, and larger-scale information management solutions. The J2EE
specification satisfies these challenges by providing a programming model
that improves development productivity, standardizes the platform for hosting
enterprise applications, and ensures portability of developed applications
with an extensive test suite.</p>

<p>J2EE architecture supports component-based development of multi-tier enterprise
applications. A J2EE application system typically includes the following tiers:</p>

<dl>
<dt class="dlterm">Client tier</dt>

<dd>In the client tier, Web components, such as Servlets and JavaServer Pages
(JSPs), or standalone Java applications provide a dynamic interface
to the middle tier.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Middle tier</dt>

<dd>In the server tier, or middle tier, enterprise beans and Web Services
encapsulate reusable, distributable business logic for the application. These
server-tier components are contained on a J2EE Application Server, which provides
the platform for these components to perform actions and store data.</dd>


<dt class="dlterm">Enterprise data tier</dt>

<dd>In the data tier, the enterprise's data is stored and persisted, typically
in a relational database.</dd>

</dl>

<p>J2EE applications are comprised of components, containers, and services.
Components are application-level components. Web components, such as Servlets
and JSPs, provide dynamic responses to requests from a Web page. EJB components
contain server-side business logic for enterprise applications. Web and EJB
component containers host services that support Web and EJB modules.</p>
