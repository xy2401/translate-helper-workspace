<h1 class="topictitle1">Tools for Web services development</h1>


<div>
<p>Tools are provided to assist with the following aspects of Web services
development:</p>

<ul>
<li> <span class="uicontrol">Discover</span>. Browse the UDDI Business Registries
or WSIL documents to locate existing Web services for integration.</li>

<li> <span class="uicontrol">Create or Transform</span>. Create bottom-up Web services
from existing artifacts, such as Javaâ„¢ beans and enterprise beans. Create
top-down Web services from WSDL discovered from others or created using the
WSDL Editor.</li>

<li> <span class="uicontrol">Build</span>. Wrap existing artifacts as SOAP accessible
services and describe them in WSDL. The Web services wizards assist you in
generating a Java client proxy to Web services described in WSDL
and in generating Java bean skeletons from WSDL.</li>

<li> <span class="uicontrol">Deploy</span>. Deploy Web services into a variety of
test environments.</li>

<li> <span class="uicontrol">Test</span>. Test Web services running locally or remotely
in order to get instant feedback.</li>

<li> <span class="uicontrol">Develop</span>. Generate sample applications to assist
you in creating your own Web service client application.</li>

<li> <span class="uicontrol">Publish</span>. Publish Web services to a UDDI v2 or
v3 Business Registry, advertising your Web services so that other businesses
and clients can access them.</li>

</ul>
