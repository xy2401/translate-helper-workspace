<h1 class="id_title">Adding a facet to a Java EE project</h1>



<div class="id_taskbody"><p class="id_shortdesc">This topic explains how to add a facet
to an existing project in your workspace.</p>

<div class="id_context"><p class="anchor_topictop" />
<p>When you add a facet to a project, that project is configured
to perform a certain task, fulfill certain requirements, or have certain characteristics.
For example, the EAR facet sets up a project to function as an enterprise
application by adding a deployment descriptor and setting up the project's
classpath.</p>
 <p>New projects generally have
facets added to them when they are created. To add another facet to a project
that already exists, complete the following steps:</p>
</div>

<ol class="id_steps">
<li class="stepexpand"><span>In the Project Explorer view of the Javaâ„¢ EE perspective, right-click the project
and then select <span class="uicontrol">Properties</span>.</span></li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Select the <span class="uicontrol">Project Facets</span> page in the in
the Properties window.</span> This page lists the facets in the project
and their versions.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Modify Project</span> and select the check
boxes next to the facets you want the project to have.</span> <div class="p">Only
the facets that are valid for the project are listed:<ul>
<li>The list of runtimes selected for the project limits the facets shown
in the list. Only the facets compatible with all selected target runtimes
are shown.</li>

<li>The currently selected facets and their version numbers limit the other
facets shown in the list. For example, if the project contains the Dynamic
Web Module facet, the EJB Module facet is not listed because these two facets
cannot be in the same project.</li>

</ul>
You can find out more about the requirements and limitations for each
facet by right-clicking the facet name and then clicking <span class="uicontrol">Show Constraints</span>.</div>
<p>You
can also choose a preset combination of facets from the <span class="uicontrol">Presets</span> list.</p>

</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Choose a version number for the facet by clicking the current version
number and selecting the version number you want from the drop-down list.</span>
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><strong>Optional: </strong><span>To remove a facet, clear its check box.</span>
 Not all facets can be removed.</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><strong>Optional: </strong><span>If you want to limit the project so it will
be compatible with one or more runtimes, click on the Runtimes tab and select
the runtimes that you want the project to be compatible with.</span> For
more information on runtimes, see <a href="tjtargetserver.html" title="When you develop J2EE applications,&#10;you can specify the server runtime environments for your J2EE projects. The&#10;target server is specified during project creation and import, and it can&#10;be changed in the project properties. The target server setting is the default&#10;mechanism for setting the class path for J2EE projects.">Specifying target servers for J2EE projects</a>.
</li>

<li class="stepexpand"><span>Click <span class="uicontrol">Finish</span> to exit the Modify Faceted
Project dialog and then click <span class="uicontrol">OK</span>.</span></li>
