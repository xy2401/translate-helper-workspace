<h1 class="id_title">Cyclical dependencies between Java EE modules</h1>



<div class="id_conbody"><p class="id_shortdesc">A cyclical dependency between two or
more modules in an enterprise application most commonly occurs when projects
are imported from outside the Workbench.</p>

<p class="anchor_topictop" />

<p>When a cycle exists between two or more modules in an enterprise application,
the Javaâ„¢ builder
cannot accurately compute the build order of the projects. Full builds fail
under these conditions, or require several invocations.</p>

<p>Therefore, the best practice is to componentize your projects or modules.
This allows you to have your module dependencies function as a tree instead
of a cycle diagram. This practice has the added benefit of producing a better
factored and layered application.</p>
