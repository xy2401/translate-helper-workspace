<h1 class="topictitle1">Tuning validators</h1>



<div><p>Whether or not a validator validates a particular resource depends
on the filters that are in place for that validator.</p>

<div class="section"><div class="p">When a validator is first developed, the implementer of the validator
defines a default set of filters. These filters may be based on:<ul>
<li>file extensions</li>

<li>folder of file names</li>

<li>project natures</li>

<li>project facets</li>

<li>content types</li>

</ul>
Through the Validation Filters dialog, you are able to further tune these
settings.Normally you would simply keep the defaults, however two reasons
why you may want to tune validation are:<ul>
<li>Performance: if you have a very large workspace, you could reduce the
amount of validation.</li>

<li>Non standard conventions: if you use a  non standard naming convention
(for example stores XML in files with an .acme-xml extension), you could still
enable the appropriate validators to run against those files.</li>

</ul>
You can access this dialog by clicking <span class="menucascade"><span class="uicontrol">Window</span>
 &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Preferences</span> &gt; <span class="uicontrol">Validation</span></span> and
then clicking <span class="uicontrol">Settings</span> beside each validator.</div>
<p>Filters
are stored in groups. There are two types of groups: Include groups and Exclude
groups. You can have as many Include groups as you like. Filters inside of
an Include group cause resources to be validated. If any rule matches then
the entire group matches. Inside of a group the filter rules are OR’d together.
However individual Include groups are AND’ed together. You can have one Exclude
group. If any of its filter rules match, then the resource is excluded. Exclusion
takes precedence over inclusion.</p>
</div>

<div class="example"><div class="p">These rules are illustrated with this hypothetical example:<br /><img src="../images/validatefilters.jpg" alt="screen capture&#10;of the validation filters panel showing include and exclude groups" /><br /><ul>
<li>If the resource is in the disabled folder, it will be excluded because
exclusion takes precedence over everything else.</li>

<li>If the resource does not have the JSP source content type, and it does
not have the JSP fragment source content type, and it does not have a file
extension of .jsp or .jspf then it will be excluded because none of the rules
in the first group matched.</li>

<li>If the project does not have the module core nature then it will be excluded
because the single rule in the second group did not match.</li>

<li>Otherwise the resource will be validated by this particular validator.</li>

</ul>
To add a rule to a group, select the group on the left, and click <span class="uicontrol">Add
Rule</span>.</div>
