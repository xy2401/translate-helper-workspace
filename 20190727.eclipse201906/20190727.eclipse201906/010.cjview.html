<h1 class="id_title">Project Explorer view in the Java EE
perspective</h1>



<div class="id_conbody"><p class="id_shortdesc">While developing J2EE applications in
the Javaâ„¢ EE
perspective, the Project Explorer view is your main view of your J2EE projects
and resources.</p>

<p class="anchor_topictop" />

<p>The Project Explorer view provides an integrated view of all project resources,
including models of J2EE deployment descriptors, Java artifacts, resources, Web services,
databases, and dynamic Web project artifacts.</p>

<p>You should use this view to work with your J2EE deployment descriptors
and their content. You can view an enterprise application project and see
all of the modules associated with it. </p>

<p>You can also filter what you see in the Project Explorer view to hide projects,
folders, or files that you don't want to see. To enable or disable filters,
select <span class="uicontrol">Customize View...</span> from the drop-down menu at
the top right corner of the view. For more information, see <a href="cjviewfilters.html">Filters in the Project Explorer view</a>.</p>

<p>Alternately, you can filter what you see by showing or hiding working sets,
groups of related resources or projects. For more information, see <a href="../../org.eclipse.platform.doc.user/concepts/cworkset.htm" title="">Working Sets</a>.</p>
